**Date:** 2026-09-25 · **Authority:** owner ruling, in-session, after the
TT-1 acceptance: *synthesize now; no new physics fork.* · **Status:
SYNTHESIS, NOTHING BANKED.** This document assembles the frozen experiment
record into one architecture. It runs no computation, opens no fork,
promotes no status, and repairs no red gate. Every claim carries the grade
its source recorded; sources are the frozen charters, instruments, result
artifacts and verdicts, cited by fork ID. Where the mandate's categories
apply, every transition is classified **DERIVED** (in a stated class) ·
**CONSTRAINED** (restricted, not unique) · **SUPPLIED** (an input the
program prices) · **UNRESOLVED** (open or failed).

**The mandate (owner, verbatim in force):** use the frozen record as the
source of truth; reconstruct from the deepest surviving layer upward; never
promote a conditional, class-split, supplied, or irreducible result to
derived; preserve every red gate; separate mathematical identities from
physical derivations; separate model-class results from claims about
nature; identify dependencies; produce the final ledger; identify
contradictions or missing links; launch nothing.

**The question this document answers:**

> **What structure remains after repeatedly removing assumptions that the
> program could not earn?**

## 0. RELATION TO THE OLDER STRATA (scope declaration)

Three strata coexist in this repository, and this synthesis is built from
the third with the first two as fixed context:

1. **The responsive-vacuum register (V1/V2; `STATE.md`, `claims.json`,
   `NO_GO_LEDGER.md`).** Closed at its own recorded strength: zero derived
   GRUT-specific predictions; GR recovered-with-imports (area entropy,
   Unruh T); the Born rule borrowed; the arrow's existence intrinsic but
   its direction imported; the α-bridge settled-negative; μ = 4/3
   excluded. Nothing from it is rehabilitated here.
2. **The reopened foundations chain and the adjudicator track**
   (`GRUT_PROGRAM_REOPEN_01.md`; kernel transport; non-stationarity; D-1;
   clock mismatch; `GRUT_SKELETON_01.md` v02.1 with its repaired base
   rung, on `origin/adjudicator-track`).
3. **The dependency campaign** (P-1 … TT-1 on this branch): twenty-two
   frozen charter/instrument/verdict forks that attacked, one at a time,
   every assumption between the microscopic substrate and the graviton
   channel.

The synthesis reconstructs the theory bottom-up from strata 2–3. Where the
old register already priced a layer (ℏ, Born, GR recovery), the campaign
either re-derived the location of that price with more structure or left
it standing; no old price is silently dropped.

## 1. THE CENTRAL PROPOSAL, STRIPPED DOWN

> Physical reality, as far as this record reaches, is describable as
> **local microscopic degrees of freedom whose coarse-grained influence
> structure — the full hierarchy of influence data, not any single kernel
> — generates persistent spectral, geometric, and dynamical behavior,
> with every physical distinction meaningful exactly as far as declared
> access reaches.**

Three deliberate demotions distinguish this from every earlier GRUT
formulation, each forced by a specific result:

- **The constitutive kernel is not the foundation.** The kernel is
  downstream of a partition choice (P-1: "every effective kernel K(t,t′)
  is downstream of a choice of 𝔖-sector, which is why the kernel could
  never be primitive"), downstream of a state (D-1: kernel-equal theories
  split the moment their fluctuation data differ), and not even the full
  interface (P-3: (K,N) is a projection; first obstruction κ₄).
- **Stationarity is not fundamental.** The exact free cosmological kernel
  is a two-time object at order unity (non-stationarity measurement:
  best Δt-only approximation leaves R = 0.516; same-lag drift 1.53), and
  no local transport rule carries a stationary kernel across backgrounds
  (kernel transport: licensed only for lags ≲ 0.25/H₀).
- **Medium-vs-relational vocabulary is not physical content.** At fixed
  influence data and S-limited access the dispute is representational
  (D-1). What is physical is **the constraint structure on realizable
  influence data** — which is exactly what the campaign then attacked.

This proposal is a **description of what survived**, not a hypothesis
awaiting confirmation. Its claims are the classified transitions below,
each at recorded strength — nothing more.

## 2. LAYER I — MICROSCOPIC SUBSTRATE → CONTINUUM (the constructive floor)

*Source: `GRUT_SKELETON_01.md` v02.1 (adjudicator track), statuses at
check level after the 2026-09-24 instrument repairs; the §10 integrity
history travels with them.*

The strongest genuinely constructive result in the record. For a finite,
strictly local substrate with first-order passive dynamics, eliminating
the unobserved modes yields the retained-sector law

    q̇(t) = −∫₀ᵗ K_R(t−s) q(s) ds + drive,
    K_R(t) = Σ_k (v_{1k})² e^{λ_k t}   (finite N)
           → ∫ e^(−t/τ) dρ(τ)          (infinite-volume limit;
                                         completely monotone class)

| transition | status | certificate |
|---|---|---|
| memory ⇒ persistent auxiliary state (necessity) | **DERIVED** | checks P1, P2 passing |
| elimination ⇒ kernel; realization dimension = number of **distinct** eliminated modes (constructive converse) | **DERIVED** (re-banked 2026-09-24 after instrument repair) | P3 trajectory equivalence 1.4e-16; P4 distinct-modes law with degenerate-pair control returning M−1; E4a CDF convergence at the CLT rate |
| finite local non-dissipative substrate ⇒ continuous spectra + irreversible response in the infinite-volume limit; late-time kernel class t^(−d/2) | **DERIVED** (in the tested model classes) | continuum-origin 6/6; infinite-bath 4/4; irreversibility-origin 3/4 |
| spectral measure positive (Bernstein–Widder); repeated poles excluded by passivity | **DERIVED** (form) | check E5b |
| ρ recoverable from K_R | **CONSTRAINED**: unique only for light tails; support structure observable unconditionally | E2b, E2a; the gravitational kernels of interest are heavy-tailed — outside the uniqueness class |
| the **content** of ρ (support, τ₀) | **SUPPLIED** | six no-go calculations agree no mechanism inside the admitted principles generates them |
| direction of the arrow | **SUPPLIED** (existence of irreversibility derived; orientation imported boundary data) | irreversibility-origin; the register's arrow decomposition |

**Identity vs derivation:** these are physical derivations, not
identities — damping is never inserted by hand, and the constructive
converse failed at check level in version 01 of the skeleton, was
demoted, and was re-banked only by repaired measurement (P3 had recorded
the closed-loop rate; P4 had a shadowing bug; E4a compared a density to a
step). Checks outrank prose; the tag traces to the checks.

**Model-class honesty:** demonstrated in the tested classes (local
passive first-order networks under the skeleton's §3.0 admitted
principles, which include time-translation invariance). This is **not** a
theorem about all microscopic ontologies — and see §10, item M-2, for the
tension between this layer's stationarity premise and the measured
cosmological kernel.

## 3. LAYER II — THE INFLUENCE STRUCTURE AS THE EFFECTIVE INTERFACE

*Sources: D-1, P-2, P-3, P-4, S-1.*

**3.1 The Gaussian cone (P-2, CONE-CONFIRMED, 16/16).** In the declared
Gaussian class the minimal constraint structure on realizable influence
data is exactly two inequalities:

    𝔠_Gauss = { (J, ν) : J(ω) ≥ 0,  ν(ω) ≥ ℏ J(ω)/2 }

with minimality probed constructively: the vacuum saturates the floor
exactly; the interior is filled (including a genuinely non-KMS profile,
fit residual 0.750 against a 1.2e-2 thermal control); all three declared
false constraints were counterexampled by explicit realizers. KMS, FDT,
stationarity and single-pole are **states inside the cone, not
constraints on it**. Scope binding (owner): "exactly two inequalities"
holds **within the declared Gaussian class only**.

**3.2 Beyond two-point data the interface is the hierarchy (P-3, P-4).**
(K, N) does not characterize the full influence structure: exactly matched
two-point baths with κ₄ = −4g⁴ vs −8g⁴ split probe coherence by 0.338
(P-3). The full influence moment hierarchy is **complete as the interface
for declared access, in-class** (P-4, 21/22) — and its single positive
object **reduces to state positivity on the generated *-algebra**
(complete positive-definiteness), with the P-2 cone as its two-point face
(vacuum on the face at 0.0; thermal strictly inside by 0.688). Per the
binding redundancy rule this is **NULL-AS-NEW-PRINCIPLE**: the program
found no new foundational inequality — quantum admissibility restated in
influence-data language. The matrix lift ν ± J/2 ≥ 0 likewise reconstructs
from Gram vectors (P-3). **Identity, not derivation — stated as such.**

**3.3 Discrimination structure (P-4 ladder).** Genuinely different
environments matched through all cumulants of order ≤ k first differ at
the first unmatched order (constructive pairs at orders 4/6/8; the frozen
order-8 λ-window gate FAILED at 67.8 and stays red, with its labeled
diagnostic converging 325→320→276 toward 2⁸ = 256 — non-asymptotic
couplings, the count not the law). **Finite matching never certifies.**

**3.4 What selects a sector's dynamics is counting, not extremization
(S-1, SELECTION-BY-CLASS, 18/18).** Locality + symmetry power counting
selects the **exponent class** of a sector's influence data (+2.000 per
vertex momentum power; phase-space increment d−1; order-2 cancellation
+3.999) — a **compatibility principle**, not a new law. The extremization
family tested (memory duration, low-ω fraction, zero-point load) selects
nothing: the null is recorded. Amplitudes stay free (no-pin re-derived at
cone level). At matrix level the counting survives **per branch** but
does not commute with eigenvalue ordering: a cancelled branch can be
**masked** by min-dominance (P-3's red H3 gate, +2.216 not +4, preserved;
per-branch +3.999 exact) — the first genuinely matrix-level modification
of the counting law.

**3.5 Vocabulary demotion (D-1).** Non-isomorphic microscopic theories
(9-dim star vs 11-dim chain-plus-hidden-modes) with identical (K, N) are
S-observationally equivalent forever, in-class; kernel-equal theories with
different noise data split observably (0.91). The equivalence-class label
is the influence data; frameworks earn distinctness only by **the
constraint sets they induce on it**.

| transition | status |
|---|---|
| realizable Gaussian influence data → 𝔠_Gauss (two inequalities) | **DERIVED** (in-class, minimality probed) |
| the cone → a new foundational principle | **UNRESOLVED as ever-being-one — NULL-AS-NEW-PRINCIPLE** (reduces to state positivity; geometry of realizability, not an explanation of QM) |
| (K,N) → the full physics of a sector | **REFUTED as sufficient** (κ₄ obstruction); hierarchy = complete interface, in-class, for declared access |
| sector → its influence exponent class | **DERIVED** (locality+symmetry counting; per-branch with masking at matrix level) |
| sector → its point in class (amplitude, state, boundary data) | **SUPPLIED** |

---

## 4. LAYER III — ACCESS (the recurring line, and the deepest unpaid input)

*Sources: P-1, P-5, P-6, D-1, G-2/GS-1 carryovers, SX-1 L-C.*

The single most repeated structural finding of the campaign:

> **A distinction is physically meaningful to an observer exactly to the
> extent that it changes the influence data accessible to that observer**
> — and the access structure itself is not derived.

- **Subsystem structure is regime-dependent (P-1):** derivable unaided
  where dynamics genuinely distinguishes a sector (the impurity found by
  causal cohesion, gap 0.678, coarse-graining-stable); representational
  under symmetry; **supplied in generic worlds**. The criterion class
  (rank / entanglement / cohesion) is not univocal.
- **No new principle hides in access, but the seed is irreducible
  (P-5, 22/22):** factorization/embedding is representational (2.6e-15);
  the generated algebra is canonical **given** a seed; hidden-sector
  differences are invisible in-access and physical exactly at access
  boundary changes (post-quench split 0.38).
- **The seed is not dynamically selectable (P-6, 38/39, one red):**
  closure is non-injective (two chain-end seeds share the identical
  32-dim closure yet differ physically by 0.287); minimal sufficient
  seeds are path-dependent; the symmetry-degenerate control is
  unselectable (its frozen companion gate failed at exactly 0.0 and
  stays red, diagnosed, not repaired). **The access seed is a
  NON-DERIVED INPUT.**
- **Decidability class-splits by access, all the way up:** single-site
  collapse (G-2: grid ≡ chain at 2.2e-16 — structural, not
  instrumental); the interior-rotation family (GS-1: 3600 non-isometric
  members, identical data); unit-change vs unit-change-plus-deformation
  (SX-1 L-C: identical at one site to 1.3e-14, separated at full access
  by 6.05); the topology horizon (first distinguishing invariant order =
  circumference: C40/C80 at order 40; prism/Möbius at order n = 8).

| transition | status |
|---|---|
| dynamics → subsystem partition | **DERIVED where structured / representational where symmetric / SUPPLIED where generic** (P-1 trichotomy) |
| access seed → selected by minimality/closure/dynamics | **REFUTED**; the seed is **SUPPLIED** (P-5, P-6) |
| access boundary change → physical content | **DERIVED** (P-5 L-D: conditionally physical exactly there) |
| why there is an observer/access structure at all | **UNRESOLVED** (the register's observer question remains unposed) |

This is the program's guard against metaphysics: the access-relativity
principle is earned; **access itself is the deepest supplied structure in
the whole assembly**, and CARRIER (§7) reduces to it.

---

## 5. LAYER IV — GEOMETRY (reconstructible, access-relative, never absolute)

*Sources: G-1, G-2, GS-1.*

> **Geometry is reconstructible from sufficiently rich influence/access
> data, and its uniqueness is exactly access-dependent. Absolute geometry
> is unresolved.**

- **G-1 (26/34, eight reds preserved):** arrival-time functionals are
  **not** metric on finite dispersive substrates (precursor tails,
  boundary reflections) — eight frozen gates red, kept, with the located
  obstruction named. The surviving law: *reconstructable geometry is a
  function of the access structure and its causal horizon.*
- **G-2 (35/35):** the failure was the instrument class, not the
  question. Spectral functionals recover dimension (1.000 / 2.000 / 2.942
  / 1.000-quantum), hop metrics (all anchors within 0.004; exact additive
  triple 36 = 15+21), and metric density (1e-9) — while the single-site
  degeneracy stands as a **structural limit of the interface**.
- **GS-1 (19/19):** the selection table, meeting the owner's elimination
  bar:

| access | geometric selection |
|---|---|
| full site-resolved | **SELECTED-IN-CLASS** (unique up to relabeling); an isospectral candidate — trace moments equal to 2e-16 at every tested order — is **eliminated** (1.59) |
| boundary, dynamic | **the dynamic hierarchy eliminates Δ** where static resistance geometry is exactly blind (Y–Δ static-identical to 2e-16; separated at 49.7; first distinguishing invariant the ω² coefficient, 0.1975 = the analytic ‖K_AI K_II⁻² K_IA‖) |
| boundary, static only | Y–Δ blind: static geometry insufficient |
| single site | **UNDERDETERMINED** (non-isometric family survives everything earned; LocPos narrows — 94 admissible non-isometric members under the labeled diagnostic — but does not select) |
| topology | invisible below circumference order (the horizon, carried) |

| transition | status |
|---|---|
| influence + access data → geometry, within reach of access | **DERIVED** (eliminations of genuinely different candidates, incl. isospectral) |
| static geometry → full geometry | **REFUTED as sufficient**; the dynamic hierarchy is the earned extra |
| geometry under incomplete access | **CONSTRAINED**, not unique |
| absolute geometry | **UNRESOLVED** |
| the access boundary that geometry is relative to | **SUPPLIED** (P-5/P-6) |

The provisional hierarchy the record supports is
**influence → access → spectral structure → geometry** — geometry is
never fundamental in this assembly.

---

## 6. LAYER V — WHAT QUANTUM MECHANICS LOOKS LIKE FROM HERE

The discipline requirement is sharpest in this section.

**What the record locates:**

- ℏ is the **height of the cone's fluctuation floor** (P-2): the
  floor-violation target is caught by the quantum state-positivity check
  while the classical branch admits the same target. Classical physics is
  the same cone with the floor removed. At hierarchy level the floor's
  home is the multi-time operator Gram / commutator bound (P-4 H4-B).
- The matrix (noncommutative) lift of the cone holds and is strictly
  stronger than channelwise admissibility — and reduces to bath-state
  positivity / CP dilation (P-3). No proof of quantum mechanics anywhere.
- Higher connected cumulants are physically discriminating (κ₄); the
  masking phenomenon (§3.4) is the first matrix-native dynamical effect.
- The quantum leg of geometry recovery validates against the full spin
  space at 0.0 (G-2).

**What the record does not derive, prominently:**

> **ℏ is located, not derived.** The generative question — why this
> particular nonzero floor — is open. The old register's ℏ-emergence
> attempt failed (irreducible input); P-2 gave that verdict geometric
> meaning without discharging it.

> **Born weights and outcome selection are not derived.** The tested
> derivation routes returned negative results (Experiment-P record); the
> register carries the Born measure as a priced import; decoherence
> selects a pointer basis, which is not outcome selection. Nothing in
> the campaign touched this, deliberately.

> **Noncommutativity of 𝒜 enters as a primitive** on the present record:
> every audited route from a commutative substrate to quantum structure
> failed (ontology reconstruction, DISDERIVED-as-tested).

| transition | status |
|---|---|
| quantum influence constraints (cone + matrix lift + hierarchy positivity) | **DERIVED as geometry of realizability**, in-class; NULL as new principle |
| ℏ | **SUPPLIED** (located: the floor height) |
| Born measure / outcomes | **SUPPLIED / UNRESOLVED** (routes tested and failed) |
| noncommutativity of the algebra | **SUPPLIED** (emergence untested-to-failed) |
| classical limit | **DERIVED direction only** (remove the floor); which world has a floor is the supplied part |

## 7. LAYER VI — GRAVITY (the coupling chain, fully classified)

*Sources: GR-1, CP-1, EQ-1, S4-1, FS-1, CC-1, U-1, RS-1, CA-1, SX-1,
TT-1, plus the adjudicator track's coupling record and the T3
certificate.*

This is where the campaign did its most systematic work: every
assumption between the earned layers and the graviton construction was
attacked in sequence, and each either reduced to a smaller supplied
premise or died. The chain of reductions:

    minimal-stress coupling  ──CP-1──▶  geometric (proper-distance)
      coupling at ξ = 0      ──EQ-1──▶  Sel-4 ("a constant probe is a
      pure unit change")     ──S4-1──▶  temporal part conditional on
      C_cons; universality part class-split; spatial part (Sel-4x) open
                              ──FS-1──▶  free-sector exception structural;
      GeoInv the last candidate selector (candidate, never promoted)
                              ──CC-1──▶  C_cons IRREDUCIBLE, reduced to a
      supplied massless gauge/Lorentz probe
                              ──U-1───▶  universality derived under
      exchange; irreducible for decoupled sectors; universal reach supplied
                              ──RS-1──▶  retained sector: a CLASS selected
      (gapless, z = 1, locally accessible Goldstone), conditional on
      CARRIER + the supplied probe
                              ──CA-1──▶  CARRIER IRREDUCIBLE, reduced to
      an access-seed coincidence (P-6's supplied seed)
                              ──SX-1──▶  Sel-4x IRREDUCIBLE, reduced to
      the co-stretch declaration; decidability class-split by access
                              ──TT-1──▶  the physical channel classified
      (below)

**The status table (the section's central bookkeeping):**

| result | status | source |
|---|---|---|
| gravity-like spectral bath | viable, conditionally constructed (8/9 spectral checks; DOS exponent 1.972 vs 2.000); **the identification is HYPOTHESIS, not derived** | skeleton §5 |
| (K,N)_grav as a hierarchy point | **DERIVED-ADMISSIBLE**: vacuum ON the P-2 floor, thermal interior, Gram PSD, λ-free | GR-1 |
| exponent-class selection | **SELECTED-BY-STRUCTURE-IN-CLASS**: every counterfactual landed on its pre-written prediction (base 4.002/4.004/4.011; full = base+4.004; linear exactly 0); branch elimination structural | GR-1 |
| ω⁷ | **DERIVED WITHIN CLASS** on the adjudicator track (dual pre-registration executed: sealed blinded prediction confirmed at exponent ω^7.008 vs 7 ± 0.15 AND coefficient level, ratio 1.0005; kernel class t⁻⁸; mechanism identified by counterfactual controls) — and, program-wide, **occupancy evidence only**: never a forcing derivation; **the class-4 gate stays unpassed**, obstruction named exactly (minimal-stress and retained-sector imports load-bearing); κ **discharged** (amplitude-only) | skeleton §6; GR-1 L-I |
| ξ in the physical TT channel | **DERIVED-IN-CLASS: irrelevant** (whole improvement tower projected out; Λ(kk) = 0, Λ(𝟙) = 0, k² = 0 — projector algebra, an identity, stated as such); ξ survives off-shell/trace, so CP-1's strain result is retained | TT-1 Q1 |
| TT tensor structure | **FORCED in the tested class** (rank 1 per point, 1.8e-16; T₂ ∝ T₁ exactly) | TT-1 Q2, CP-1 L-TT |
| leading IR TT coupling | **FORCED in the tested class** (higher-derivative form factor suppressed as p²: ×4.000 on doubling) | TT-1 Q2 |
| higher-order TT form factors | **CONSTRAINED-NONUNIQUE** (measured rank 3, frozen prediction 4 — RED, kept; the linear-sector on-shell identity p₁·p₂ = ½(v²−1)(a²+b²) + ω₁ω₂ explains the count; curvature restores 4). Inherits the supplied Sel-4x/geometric-coupling premise | TT-1 Q2 |
| coupling selection by conservation + IR Weyl | **CLASS-SPLIT BY DIMENSION**: D = 2 → canonical (on-locus); D = 4 → the improved tensor (off-locus) — for strain probes; dissolved on-shell by TT-1 | CP-1 |
| TT channel existence | **CLASS-SPLIT by the retained sector's light cone relative to the probe's**: identically dead at exactly v = c (2.3e-16); open ∝ subluminality (v = 0.8 min vertex 0.032; curvature ratio 1.9975); closed for superluminal dispersion (no on-shell solution). Under per-sector v = c units the channel lives **only on dispersion curvature** — microscopic retained-sector content, not derived | TT-1 Q3 |
| aligned-channel death | **DERIVED twice, independently**: unimposed transversality (V8) + the kinematic closure (Cherenkov-type mismatch), analytically confirmed; the *no-go misreading* of it was itself REFUTED — the non-aligned acoustic channel is OPEN | adjudicator track; TT-1 L-K(a) |
| absolute gravitational coupling (amplitude) | **SUPPLIED** (no-pin, re-derived at cone level; κ dimensionful) | S-1 PC-D, GR-1 |
| 3D dimension-consistency gate | **RED, preserved** (5.362 vs frozen 6 ± 0.6; labeled diagnostic 5.36→5.49→5.66 converging under refinement — the gate stays red regardless) | GR-1 L-D |
| full Class-4 (forcing) derivation of gravity | **OPEN** | program-wide gate |
| the T3 certificate (dS absorptive graviton self-energy through H⁶; branch-cut class; ω⁴ flat limit; window ω ≳ 3.4H) | **external anchor, standard QFT — not a GRUT claim**; the fixed wall the eventual confrontation runs into | skeleton §3.2 |

**The two ω⁷ postures are consistent and must never be conflated:**
"derived within class" (the adjudicator track's two-sided
analytic-vs-instrument agreement, imports ledgered) and "occupancy
evidence only" (the campaign fence) describe the same object at two
scopes. Within-class derivation ≠ class-4 forcing; the campaign's fence
exists precisely because the imports (retained sector, coupling premise —
now reduced to CARRIER + co-stretch + massless probe) are load-bearing.
No absolute exponent was recomputed anywhere in the campaign; the v3
record and its convention were never reopened.

**Cosmological sector (carried context, stratum 2):** the exact free FRW
kernel is computable from admitted inputs but **no local substitution
rule** transports the dS kernel to it (best member 34% wrong at long
lags; ε ≥ 0.4725 everywhere — no small parameter); the kernel is
genuinely two-time (R = 0.516); the old four-e-folds adverse comparison
is **re-typed as underdetermined** (clock-mismatch verdict C: the seam is
two backgrounds, not two clocks; the filed lag 1/H₀ exceeds H₀t₀ =
0.951). The noise/KMS side on FRW needs three RELOCATION-class supplied
items (a state choice, a temperature structure, a proved stationary
reduction).

## 8. THE LEDGER — earned vs constrained vs supplied vs unresolved

The central bookkeeping device of the working theory. Nothing below may
be quoted without its column.

### 8.1 DERIVED / demonstrated within stated classes

- Continuum, dissipation and irreversibility from a finite, strictly
  local, passive substrate in the infinite-volume limit (t^(−d/2) class);
  memory ⟺ persistent auxiliary state, both directions at check level.
- Spectral form constraints: positivity (Bernstein–Widder), no repeated
  poles (passivity), conditional uniqueness of ρ (light tails), support
  observability.
- The Gaussian influence cone 𝔠_Gauss (exactly two inequalities,
  minimality probed); its matrix lift; hierarchy-level positivity as the
  single positive object — **as geometry of realizability** (reduces to
  state positivity: no new principle).
- Higher-cumulant physical discrimination (κ₄; first-unmatched-order
  ladder); in-class interface-completeness of the hierarchy.
- Exponent-class selection by locality + symmetry counting; per-branch
  counting with masking at matrix level.
- Access-relativity of physical distinctions; physicality of access
  boundary changes; the P-1 selection trichotomy.
- Spectral geometry reconstruction with eliminations of genuinely
  different candidates (isospectral included); the dynamic hierarchy
  strictly beyond static geometry; the topology horizon law
  (first invariant order = circumference).
- Classification of constant spatial rescalings: co-stretch ≡ unit
  change (a data identity); "any constant rescaling is a unit change"
  **false** in the tested class (rigid stretch observable at 0.013).
- Clock universality **under exchange** (forced ≥ 0.13 vs 9e-16;
  g → 0 continuous); O ~ H forced for generic non-integrable chains
  given C_cons.
- The P-2 cone's earned cut of the classical carrier (ν − J/2 = −0.192);
  RS-1's earned eliminations (fermions under local access, flexural,
  gapped) — conditional on CARRIER.
- ξ-irrelevance in the physical TT channel (identity-grade); TT tensor
  and leading IR coupling forced in the tested family; aligned-channel
  death (twice, independently); channel-existence classification by
  relative light cone.
- Vocabulary demotions: medium-vs-relational representational at fixed
  influence data; factorization/embedding representational.

### 8.2 CONSTRAINED, not uniquely selected

- The memory spectrum ρ within the heavy-tailed class (support
  observable, measure not unique).
- Subsystem/partition criteria (three inequivalent notions, coinciding
  only where structure is strong).
- The retained microscopic sector: a **class** selected (gapless, z = 1,
  locally accessible Goldstone), the member not; full-stress coupling
  permitted, not forced.
- The carrier set after the cone's cut: three quantum carriers survive;
  a non-carrier bath survives everything earned.
- Higher-order TT form factors (rank 3–4 by class; the red rank count
  stands).
- Geometry under incomplete access (interior-rotation families; LocPos
  narrows, does not select).
- The strain-probe coupling family (nullity 2: canonical +
  ξ·improvement).

### 8.3 SUPPLIED / irreducible (each reduced to its smallest form by a
dedicated fork — this list is the theory's honest price)

| input | reduced to | fork |
|---|---|---|
| ℏ | the cone's floor height (located) | P-2 (+ prior record) |
| the access seed | a non-derived declaration; physical at boundary changes | P-5, P-6 |
| CARRIER ("the gravitational bath is the geometry carrier") | an access-seed coincidence | CA-1 |
| C_cons (conserved-current coupling) | a supplied massless gauge/gauge-redundant/Lorentz probe | CC-1 |
| universal reach (every sector couples through exchange-carrying components) | supplied; universality then derived under exchange | U-1 |
| Sel-4x (constant length rescaling = unit change) | the co-stretch declaration ("a constant probe rescales every scale, intrinsic ones included") | SX-1 |
| the cross-sector light-cone relation (probe c vs sector c) | supplied (U-1 territory); under per-sector v = c the TT channel rides on dispersion curvature | TT-1 |
| sector amplitudes, states, boundary data (the point in the class) | no-pin, cone-level | S-1, P-2 |
| ρ's support and τ₀; the absolute macroscopic scale | anchors (G-and-Λ-analogous, but functional-sized) | skeleton §4 |
| arrow **direction**; the low-entropy past | imported boundary data | stratum-1 record |
| Born measure; outcome selection | imported; tested routes failed | Experiment-P, register |
| noncommutativity of 𝒜 | primitive on the present record | ontology reconstruction |
| FRW state choice, temperature structure, stationary reduction | three relocation-class items for any noise/KMS transport | kernel-transport verdict |

### 8.4 UNRESOLVED / open / failed (kept red)

- **Class-4**: no forcing derivation of gravity; gate open, obstruction
  named (the supplied inputs of 8.3 are load-bearing).
- **GR-1's 3D gate: RED** (5.362 vs 6 ± 0.6), diagnostic attached, never
  repaired.
- **G-1's eight reds** (arrival-time metric program dead on finite
  dispersive substrates).
- The other preserved reds: P-6 degenerate-companion (0.0); P-3 H3
  eigenvalue (+2.216, masking found); P-4 order-8 window (67.8); EQ-1
  static discriminator (the "static separates" claim withdrawn); RS-1
  flexural ">4" (R ~ N·d²); TT-1 form-factor rank (3 vs 4).
- Absolute geometry; a universal access law; the observer question
  (unposed); the unification of the subsystem criterion class.
- Derivation of ℏ; Born/outcomes; the retained sector's dispersion
  curvature (the TT channel's existence rides on it); operator ordering
  (fenced); the D = 4 strain-class ξ choice (off-shell only, after TT-1).
- The Standard Model: silent — no node, no claim, no route.
- The T3 confrontation (mapping the derived matter-side class onto the
  certificate's in-window observable): **not yet run**.

## 9. THE DEPENDENCY MAP (what consumes what)

Read "A ⟵ B" as "A is conditional on B". Supplied inputs are UPPERCASE.

    TT channel existence  ⟵  relative LIGHT CONE (or, at per-sector
                              v = c: retained-sector dispersion curvature
                              — unresolved microscopic content)
    TT coupling beyond leading IR  ⟵  SEL-4X (co-stretch) / geometric-
                                       coupling choice
    retained-sector class selection (RS-1)  ⟵  CARRIER + MASSLESS PROBE
    CARRIER (CA-1)  ⟵  ACCESS SEED (P-6)
    C_cons (CC-1)  ⟵  MASSLESS GAUGE/LORENTZ PROBE
    clock universality (U-1)  ⟵  UNIVERSAL REACH (derived only under
                                  exchange)
    Sel-4 temporal part (S4-1)  ⟵  C_cons
    GeoInv (FS-1)  ⟵  candidate only; never promoted; conditional on
                       C_cons
    geometry selection (GS-1)  ⟵  ACCESS BOUNDARY (P-5/P-6)
    ω⁷ - as - occupancy (GR-1)  ⟵  minimal-stress + retained sector
        — i.e., after the campaign: CARRIER + SEL-4X + MASSLESS PROBE
        + ACCESS SEED; κ discharged
    the cone's quantum floor  ⟵  ℏ (located, supplied)
    kernel K(t,t′)  ⟵  partition (P-1) ⟵ ACCESS; state (D-1)
    substrate → continuum layer  ⟵  admitted principles incl.
        TIME-TRANSLATION INVARIANCE (see M-2 below)
    everything observational  ⟵  ARROW DIRECTION, BOUNDARY DATA,
        BORN MEASURE (strata 1–2 prices, still standing)

The graph has a striking shape: **most load-bearing structural
assumptions above the influence layer collapse into two major stems —
access and probe structure — with quantum and boundary-data inputs
remaining separately priced.** The campaign compressed a diffuse
assumption cloud into those two named stems plus the separately priced
inputs (ℏ, state/boundary data, sector content). *(Wording amended per
AMENDMENT 01.)*

## 10. CONTRADICTIONS AND MISSING LINKS EXPOSED BY THE ASSEMBLY

Found by this synthesis pass; none is a repair, each is a statement about
the assembled record.

- **M-1 (consistency, resolved by scoping): the two ω⁷ postures.** The
  adjudicator track banks "derived within class at exponent and
  coefficient level"; the campaign fence says "occupancy evidence only."
  Consistent — the first is a within-class derivation with imports
  ledgered, the second is the refusal to let it stand in for class-4 —
  but only if always quoted with scope. This document is the record's
  first place both statements sit in one table (§7).
- **M-2 (genuine missing link): the stationarity seam.** Layer I's
  constructive floor is derived under admitted principles that include
  time-translation invariance; the cosmological kernel record proves the
  physical kernel of interest is two-time at order unity (R = 0.516)
  with no licensed local transport. **The substrate construction and the
  cosmological sector do not yet meet.** No committed calculation builds
  the Layer-I limit on a non-stationary background. This is a missing
  link, not a contradiction: the layers' scopes are disjoint, and
  nothing forces them to compose — yet the theory needs them to.
- **M-3 (genuine missing link): geometry stops at space.** Everything
  geometric that is earned is spatial/metric-from-influence; the causal
  cone across sectors — the very thing TT-1's existence split turns on —
  is supplied. No earned construction produces a *common* light cone
  from influence data. U-1 shows where it would have to come from
  (exchange), and that exchange forcing is exactly the part that is
  derived; what is not derived is that every sector is in the
  exchange-coupled component (universal reach).
- **M-4 (tension, held open): the free-sector loophole.** S4-1/FS-1:
  the clock-coupling derivation is forced for generic interacting
  sectors but structurally fails for free/integrable ones — and GR-1's
  retained sector (free phonons) **falls in the non-derived class**. The
  construction's own preferred sector sits in the exception class of its
  own selection theorem. GeoInv is the recorded candidate that would
  close this; it was deliberately never promoted.
- **M-5 (dependency concentration): dispersion curvature.** Under RS-1's
  per-sector v = c convention, the existence of the physical graviton
  pair channel rests entirely on retained-sector dispersion curvature —
  a microscopic quantity nothing in the record constrains, in either
  sign. TT-1 established the classification; the record is silent on the
  point-in-class.
- **M-6 (bookkeeping): the Standard Model and observers.** Matter
  content silent, observers unposed — inherited from stratum 1 and
  unchanged by twenty-two forks. The assembly makes the silence sharper:
  the access seed (§4) is the natural place the observer question now
  lives, and it is a supplied input.
- **M-7 (integrity, carried): narrative-vs-run.** Five documented
  instances of verdict prose asserting what checks refuted (skeleton
  §10), all caught by adversarial verification, all repaired by
  measurement or preserved red. The asymmetric-error-budget finding
  (negatives faced no gauntlet) is part of the record; the campaign's
  red-gate discipline is the systemic answer. This document contains no
  status that does not trace to a frozen check outcome or an owner
  ruling.

## 11. WHAT THE ASSEMBLED THEORY IS — AND THE BOUNDARY WHERE IT STOPS

The Phase-II question — *can the surviving pieces coexist as one
architecture without re-smuggling eliminated assumptions?* — has the
answer: **yes, they compose, with exactly two seams (M-2, M-3) where
composition is not yet constructed rather than inconsistent.** No
transition in §§2–7 consumes an assumption that another fork eliminated;
the eliminated ones (a primitive kernel, fundamental stationarity, a
unique subsystem functional, absolute geometry, blanket C_cons, blanket
Sel-4x, ω⁷-as-selector, a self-normalizing coupling) appear nowhere as
inputs. That is the assembly test passed at the level this document can
test it: by inspection of the classified dependency graph, not by a new
instrument.

Stated as the record permits:

> **A broad class of observable physical structures — continuum
> dynamics, memory, dissipation, quantum-shaped fluctuation constraints,
> access-relative geometry, a forced TT coupling skeleton — emerges in a
> definite hierarchy from local microscopic dynamics; and the same
> record identifies, by exhaustive attack, exactly which additional
> structures cannot yet be derived: an access seed, a probe structure
> (massless, gauge/Lorentz-redundant, universally reaching), a co-stretch
> declaration, ℏ, boundary/state data, and the microscopic content of
> the retained sector.**

That sentence is the working theory. It is deliberately not "GRUT derives
the equations of nature from nothing" — the record refuted every version
of that claim it tested, and the refutations are load-bearing results,
not embarrassments.

**Where explanatory status is blocked (Phase-III candidates, named, not
opened, not ranked beyond what the dependency graph itself says):**

1. **The access seed / observer boundary** — the deepest stem: CARRIER
   and geometry-relativity both reduce to it (P-6: not dynamically
   selectable, path-dependent).
2. **The supplied probe structure** — the second stem: C_cons,
   universality's reach, and the coupling chain all price it (CC-1, U-1).
3. **The stationarity seam (M-2)** — the one place two *earned* layers
   fail to meet.
4. **Retained-sector dispersion curvature (M-5)** — the narrowest, most
   falsifiable single question TT-1 left.
5. **ℏ's floor and the Born measure** — the quantum prices, unmoved by
   the campaign.

Per the mandate, this document selects none of them. The dependency graph
says the two *stems* (1, 2) dominate the count of downstream
conditionals; the two *seams* (3, 4) are where a bounded instrument could
next produce a decisive red-or-green. The choice is the owner's.

## 12. GOVERNANCE OF THIS DOCUMENT

- Built from: the frozen verdicts and commit-sealed summaries of the 22
  campaign forks (P-1…TT-1 with their charters and artifacts on this
  branch), the foundations chain (kernel transport, non-stationarity,
  D-1, clock mismatch, ontology reconstruction), `GRUT_SKELETON_01.md`
  v02.1 (`origin/adjudicator-track`, commit 90218f5), and the stratum-1
  register documents at their recorded strength.
- Banks nothing; moves no tier; reopens nothing; every red gate above is
  quoted red.
- Fences honored throughout: no absolute exponent computed or compared
  to 7; ω⁷ occupancy-only outside its scoped within-class row; v3 not
  reopened; ℏ located-not-generated; operator ordering fenced; Λ_R /
  Matsubara / Π₀ / U5 untouched; no external dispatch (D-1 standing
  direction).
- Supersedes, as the program's working synthesis, the *narrative* role
  of earlier syntheses (`GRUT_FINAL_SYNTHESIS_01.md`,
  `GRUT_MINIMUM_CORE.md`, the skeleton's §12) without altering them:
  they remain the record of their own dates.
- Correction protocol: errors in this document are corrected by dated
  amendment or owner edit, never silent rewrite.

## HARD STOP

Synthesis recorded. The decision this stop waits on: **the owner reads
the assembled architecture, its two stems and two seams, and either
amends the synthesis or selects the Phase-III question.** No fork is
opened by this document.

## AMENDMENT 01 (owner ruling, 2026-09-25 — applied as a dated amendment, per §12)

The owner accepted this synthesis as the architectural foundation of the
theory paper, with one conceptual correction, applied above in §9:

- The two-stems claim must not read as "everything reduces to two
  stems." The precise statement is: **most load-bearing structural
  assumptions above the influence layer collapse into two major stems —
  access and probe structure — with quantum and boundary-data inputs
  remaining separately priced.** The synthesis's own §8.3 table already
  listed the separately priced inputs; the §9 headline sentence now
  matches it.

The owner also fixed the strongest supported claim-form, binding on all
successor documents: not *"GRUT derives spacetime and gravity from local
microscopic dynamics"* but *"GRUT identifies a hierarchy in which local
microscopic dynamics can generate continuum spectral structure, influence
functionals, memory and dissipation, and — given an access structure —
recoverable spatial geometry and a constrained graviton-response sector;
and it identifies the specific structures that remain irreducible inputs
or unresolved seams."*

Successor document: `GRUT_THEORY_PAPER_WORKING_01.md`. No physics fork
before that paper exists (owner ruling).
