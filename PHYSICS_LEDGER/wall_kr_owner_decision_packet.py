"""
OWNER DECISION PACKET AFTER 4cb5d23 — validation instrument.

Validates the packet WITHOUT making any decision it presents. No physics.
The load-bearing gate is NO-SELECTION: the packet must present options and
choose none of them.

Self-scan discipline: selection/authority tokens are built at RUNTIME by
concatenation, and the scan targets the EMITTED PACKET, never this source.
