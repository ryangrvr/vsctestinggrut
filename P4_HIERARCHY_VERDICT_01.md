# P-4 — THE HIERARCHY ATTACK: VERDICT

**Date:** 2026-09-25 · **Charter:** `P4_HIERARCHY_CHARTER_01.md` (frozen at
`d0fc014` before the run) · **Instrument:** `calc/p4_hierarchy.py` ·
**Artifact:** `P4_HIERARCHY_RESULT.json` (sha `58fc0b652ed71068…`) ·
**Battery 21/22** — the one failure is a frozen gate preserved as found,
with a labeled post-hoc diagnostic resolving it (out-of-asymptotic-regime
contamination, not a physics leak). All matching gates passed at 1e-9
BEFORE any coherence comparison; both tamper detectors fired; the
matched-relabeling control held at 1.6e-13.

## THE ANSWER TO "WHAT REPLACES THE GAUSSIAN CONE?"

> **CHARACTERIZED-AND-REDUCIBLE.** The single positive object exists:
> **complete positive-definiteness of the influence moment hierarchy** —
> every finite Gram matrix of monomials in {B(t)} is PSD — which is state
> positivity on the generated *-algebra. It contains the P-2 cone as its
> **two-point face** (demonstrated, not assumed: the vacuum sits ON the
> face, |C(t)| = C(0) to 0.0e+00 — P-2's boundary reproduced; a thermal
> state sits strictly inside by 0.688). The classical face (Hankel
> positivity) and the quantum face (the commutator bound — the
> hierarchy-level home of the ℏ floor) both carry halt-grade tamper
> detectors, and both fired on demand. **Per the binding redundancy rule:
> reducible to state positivity — NULL-AS-NEW-PRINCIPLE.** The unification
> dividend is real and is reported separately without promotion: **one
> Gram condition replaces the cone's two axioms as its low-order faces.**

## THE MATCHING LADDER — finite matching never certifies

- **Order-4 mismatch** (P-3 pair): Δ scales as λ⁴ (ratio 17.2, window 16).
- **Order-6 mismatch** (new pair, equal power sums p₁, p₂, different p₃;
  matched at 1e-9 through ALL cumulants of order ≤ 4 including a
  multi-time connected 4-point at 4.1e-14): Δ scales as λ⁶ (ratio 54.9,
  window 64).
- **Order-8 mismatch** (4-spin pair, p₁, p₂, p₃ matched, p₄ differing;
  quartic roots solved in-run): the frozen λ = 0.4/0.2 gate **FAILED
  (ratio 67.8) and stays red** — at those couplings (up to ~2.0) the
  series is not asymptotic. The labeled post-hoc diagnostic: successive
  halving ratios **325 → 320 → 276, converging monotonically toward
  2⁸ = 256** (last step within 8%, at the precision floor). Discrimination
  enters at order 8 as constructed.

**LADDER-ESTABLISHED:** constructive mismatch pairs at orders 4, 6, 8,
with λ-scaling confirming at every rung that **discrimination enters
exactly at the first unmatched cumulant order.** Finite matching never
certifies equivalence. Full-hierarchy matching certifies **in-class**
(P-3's Q5 as the positive control at 1.1e-14; bounded-moment determinacy
cited as standard mathematics, claimed in-class only).

## THE DESCRIPTIVENESS ATTACK (owner point 7)

**No constraint-satisfying pair with an influence-untracked physics
difference was constructible.** Every residual difference, at every rung,
tracked a named unmatched cumulant with its predicted λ-scaling. In the
tested class the hierarchy is **complete as the interface** for the
declared access. Per the frozen scope line: this is
interface-completeness, not a claim about physics outside the access
boundary — D-1's lesson carries: **access, not vocabulary, is where
distinctions live.**

## WHAT STANDS AFTER P-2 → P-3 → P-4, AT RECORDED STRENGTH

> **𝔠_full (candidate, now attack-tested at three rungs) = the completely
> positive-definite influence hierarchies.** Its two-point face is the
> P-2 cone; its classical sections are Hankel positivity; its quantum
> content is the commutator face whose scale is ℏ (located, not
> generated). It is **not a new law of nature** — it is quantum state
> positivity in influence coordinates — and it is, on everything tested,
> **the complete interface**: what a sector IS, to any observer coupled
> through it, is its point in this structure.

**The non-derived remainder, unchanged and explicit:** which hierarchy
point reality realizes per sector (the selection question, now
branch-classes + spectral competition + supplied amplitudes/states); the
floor's scale ℏ; everything at the type-III boundary; and the access
structure itself.

## DEFECT HISTORY (disclosed)

One frozen gate failed and is preserved: the order-8 λ-window was set
where the strongly-coupled pair's series is not asymptotic; the post-hoc
diagnostic (labeled, a measurement) resolved it as contamination, with the
asymptotic ratio converging to 256. No other defects; no post-hoc edits to
any verdict-bearing quantity.

## HARD STOP

Verdict recorded. The waiting decision: **the owner rules on 𝒯's
next layer** — the natural menu now being (a) the gravity sector consuming
the branch/masking selection law with (K, N)_grav as a hierarchy point
(class-4 gate still open), (b) the geometry leg, or (c) the access-
structure question that D-1 and P-4 have now jointly promoted (what
determines the physical access boundary — the last place a genuinely new
principle could hide on this record). Λ_R, Matsubara, Π₀, U5 remain
fenced.

> DESCRIPTIVENESS ATTACK" above records a conclusion that the instrument entered as

> search, and no pair with matched full hierarchies was constructed or searched for. It must not
> be cited as an executed test. Interface-completeness at the declared scope rests on the class
