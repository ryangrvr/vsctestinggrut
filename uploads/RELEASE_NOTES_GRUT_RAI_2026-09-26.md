# GRUT-RAI — public-record release (26 September 2026)

This release is the repository snapshot behind the GRUT program's consolidated public record. It is the archival companion of the paper, not a claim of its own.

**The paper.** *GRUT — Grand Responsive Universe Theory: Consolidated Theory, Formal Architecture, Results, Limits, and Completion Program*, D. Ryan Grover, 26 September 2026. DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.22983638](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22983638) (all versions of the theory record: [10.5281/zenodo.19803663](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19803663)). The paper's authoritative Markdown source, its conversion-only LaTeX/PDF build, and its figure are in `uploads/`.

**This software record.** GRUT-RAI, all versions: [10.5281/zenodo.18993689](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18993689). This release carries its own version DOI, minted on deposit. GRUT-RAI is the computational and provenance infrastructure of the program — instruments, pre-registration charters, results, verdicts, and the dependency ledger. It is not the physical theory, and it is not an authority that can make a physical claim true.

**Source boundary.** The paper consolidates `master-w25bu9` through commit `6abbf316` (26 September 2026, 02:54 UTC). The foundations record of the unmerged `adjudicator-track` branch (tip `90218f5`) is archived byte-exact, with SHA-256 sums, in `archive/adjudicator-track_90218f5/` (51 files), so this snapshot contains every source the paper cites. Files committed after the boundary are the manuscript, its build, this release's metadata, and the archive itself; they add no computation and change no status.

## What this release contains, relative to the v5.0 Program Record (7 September 2026)

- **Program closure and reopening.** The program was formally closed on 23 September 2026 (`GRUT_PROGRAM_CLOSURE_01.md`) and reopened by owner ruling on 25 September 2026 (`GRUT_PROGRAM_REOPEN_01.md`) as a theory-development effort. Reopening is not rehabilitation: every standing negative grading carries over, including zero GRUT-specific derived predictions and the twice-failed distinctive-theory adjudication.
- **The foundations record (24 September 2026).** GRUT Skeleton v02.1, the `u3_*` instruments with their results, the sealed T2 analytic ledger, the rebuilt on-shell coupling instrument (20/20; the ω⁷ result, graded within-class occupancy evidence), and the coupling adjudications, including the same-evening refutation of the "Cherenkov no-go". Archived under `archive/adjudicator-track_90218f5/`.
- **The dependency campaign (25 September 2026).** Twenty-four chartered forks — P-1 through P-6, D-1, S-1, G-1, G-2, GS-1, GR-1, CP-1, EQ-1, S4-1, FS-1, CC-1, U-1, RS-1, CA-1, SX-1, TT-1, C1-a, and C1-a2 — each with its charter committed before its run, its instrument and SHA-hashed result committed with its verdict, and an owner ruling. Seventeen failed frozen gates are preserved in ten red-register entries, none reinterpreted.
- **The first domain extension.** C1-a extends the core construction, in class, to finite stepped nonstationary dynamics (exact to 10⁻¹²), and C1-a2 certifies, at its stated scope and with its calibration disclosed, that no single spectral measure or Δt-only kernel packages the resulting two-time memory.
- **The synthesis and formal layer.** GRUT Working Theory 01, Theory Paper Working Drafts 01–02, and Formalizations 01–02 with their dated amendments.
- **The public record itself** (`uploads/`): the consolidated paper (Markdown and PDF), Figure 1, the LaTeX build (`uploads/build/`), the owner's draft preserved as received, the editorial changelog, and the Zenodo description. The edition passed an in-house multi-agent factual audit, a readability review by simulated outside readers, and a final three-pass fact-check of the complete text against the repository (~860 claims re-verified). All passes were AI-operated; none is external review.
- **Deposit metadata:** `.zenodo.json` (this software record) and `CITATION.cff` (with the paper as preferred citation).

## Scope statement

This is an in-house research record.

- No external peer review is claimed, and external review is deferred by owner direction (paper, §29.4).
- No experimental validation is claimed.
- No confirmed novel quantitative prediction is claimed; the GRUT-specific prediction ledger stands at zero.
- It is not a completed theory of everything.

Earlier releases in this lineage carried stronger claims that the current record has demoted; where they conflict, the paper's scoped statements govern (paper, §29). The June 2026 "GRUT ToE v4.0" deposit (10.5281/zenodo.20783057) is withdrawn by its author, and nothing in it should be cited as a result.

## How to verify a result

```
git clone https://github.com/ryangrvr/GRUT-RAI
cd GRUT-RAI && git checkout public-record-2026-09-26
cp -r calc /tmp/grut_calc && cd /tmp/grut_calc
python3 c1a2_packaging.py     # prints "7/7 gated checks passed"
```

The campaign instruments are pure Python 3 standard library and deterministic or fixed-seed; run them from a copy, as shown, because each writes its result file into the parent directory. The foundations instruments are in `archive/adjudicator-track_90218f5/calc/`; six are pure standard library, and the rest need `numpy` (two also `scipy`), with Python 3.12 recorded as the tested environment. Paper §28 and Appendix G give the full verification map, commit by commit.

AI agents (Claude, Anthropic) were used as computational, drafting, and audit instruments under the author's direction; the author issued every status ruling. If a future result changes a status, the change enters through a new dated source boundary and a new record — this snapshot is never silently rewritten.
