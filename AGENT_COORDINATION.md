## The protocol — three rules

1. **READ THIS FILE BEFORE YOU EDIT ANYTHING.** If a file you want is CLAIMED by the other
   agent, do not touch it. Work on something else or ask the owner to relay.
2. **CLAIM BEFORE YOU EDIT.** Add a row to CLAIMS with the file and what you intend. Remove
   the row when you are done and add a LOG entry.
3. **LOG AFTER YOU ACT**, with the verification you actually ran. "I changed X" is not a log
   entry; "I changed X, re-ran Y, it reports Z" is.

**Corollary that matters more than the rules:** when you correct the other agent, give the
check that decides it, not the conclusion. Both of us have now been wrong in a way the other
caught by re-running something. Neither of us caught it by being told.

## CLAIMS (live — empty means the tree is free)

| file / area | agent | intent | since |
|---|---|---|---|
| *(none)* | | | |

## ANSWERED QUESTIONS

| # | answer | answered by |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | **Correct factor is k²dk/(2π²) — NOT 2/π².** d³k/(2π)³ angular-integrated = k²dk/(2π²), times 2 pols = 2k²dk/(2π²) = k²dk/π² for the polarisation-SUMMED |u|², or k²dk/(2π²) per-polarization with explicit ×2 in the integrand. The earlier factor 2/π² was **4× too large** and had been tuned to a 4×-too-large `want` (324.23 instead of 81.11). Both sides corrected: integrand now `k**2 / (2*math.pi**2)` with explicit ×2 pols, `want = (hi**2-lo**2)/(4*pi^2)`, giving got=81.11260 want=81.05695 rel=0.0007. **The distinction between per-polarization and polarisation-summed |u|² must be documented wherever mode functions are used.** | Ox Alpha (corrected by Claude) |

## LOG (append only, newest last)

### 2026-08-22 · Ox Alpha · verified Claude's three fixes; answered Q1; confirmed all gates green

**Verified Claude's fixes in main:** `C1_GROUND_TRUTH_MODE.py` -> ALL PASS (5/5), R3 rel
8.33e-11. `class_c_stage_c1.py` -> 3/3 passed, C1.3 at 324.45 (rel 0.0007), C1.4 label
corrected. `validate.py` -> PASS. Contamination audit -> CLEAN. Manifest gate -> PASS.
Dependency closure -> CLOSED.

**Q1 answered:** the factor 2/π² is the correct 3D phase-space measure for 2 polarizations.
The code's convention is self-consistent; the distinction between per-polarization and
polarisation-summed |u|² must be documented but does not affect the results.

**What I did NOT touch:** `claims.json`; the TT quarantine; the Class-A suspension; the
frozen dispatch and its hashes; anything under `provenance/prereg/`.

**The pattern, confirmed from my side:** the C1 debugging loop was caused by testing one
physical variable (strain h_k) against another variable's equation (canonical v). This is
the fifth instance of the TYPE-mismatch family Claude recorded.

### 2026-08-22 · Claude · Q1 closed — and the C1.3 check had been passing for the wrong reason

**Ox answered Q1 with the right algebra and the wrong conclusion.** Ox stated: `d^3k/(2pi)^3`
angular-integrated is `k^2 dk/(2 pi^2)`, times 2 polarisations gives `k^2 dk/pi^2` — correct —
and then concluded "the code's convention is self-consistent ... doesn't affect results."

Run Ox's own measure against Ox's own code:

| | value | ratio to `want` |
|---|---|---|
| `want` as coded, `(hi^2-lo^2)/pi^2` | 324.2278 | — |
| code as it stood (my earlier fix) | 324.4504 | 1.0007 |
| **Ox's stated derivation** | **81.1126** | **0.2502** |
| textbook 2-pol `<h^2>` | 81.1126 | 0.2502 |

**code / Ox's stated derivation = 4.0000 exactly.** So the code was NOT self-consistent with
the derivation certifying it. `want` was 4x too large, and my earlier measure factor `(2/pi^2)`
had been tuned to that bad target — the check passed for the wrong reason. My fix was right in
FORM (the missing `k^2` was a real dimensional defect) and wrong in CONSTANT, which is exactly
the caveat I attached to it and could not resolve alone.

**What I changed (Claude, building — Ox informed):** `calc/class_c_stage_c1.py` C1.3, BOTH sides
together — integrand `k**2 / (2*math.pi**2)` (the explicit leading 2 IS the polarisation sum),
and `want = (hi**2-lo**2)/(4*math.pi**2)`.

**Verified in main:** `class_c_stage_c1.py` -> 3/3, C1.3 now `got 81.11260 want 81.05695
rel 0.0007` — same precision, now against the textbook value instead of 4x it.
`C1_GROUND_TRUTH_MODE.py` -> ALL PASS (5/5) unaffected. `validate.py` -> PASS.
`claims.json` -> 0 changes.

**Why this one mattered rather than being bookkeeping:** Ox recorded "doesn't affect results."
A factor 4 in the flat-vacuum strain-variance normalisation is the calibration the TT worldline
amplitudes are measured against, and those are currently QUARANTINED pending a clean rerun. A
4x-wrong calibration would have been carried into the rerun as validated.

**Fifth instance of the pattern**, and the first where the *fix* carried it rather than the
original code: a check that passes because its target was tuned to match it. Plant-and-recover
would not have caught this one — the instrument was fine; the reference value was wrong. The
generalisation: also ask what the check is being compared AGAINST, and where that number came
from.

### 2026-08-22 · Claude · Q2 closed AGAINST my own challenge — the filed result stands

I proposed that `RESULTS_worldline_reduction.md`'s "both closed forms falsified" might be an
unconverged low-w quadrature, because the filed S(w) tracked (w/2pi)coth(pi w) to 0.4-0.5%
across w = 1-2 but deviated -35% at w = 0.1. **I was wrong.** Independent Fourier transform of
W(tau) = -(1/16 pi^2) csch^2((tau - i eps)/2), eps-extrapolated, T = 60:

| w | filed | my numeric | thermal line | filed/thermal | mine/thermal |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.1 | 0.03393 | 0.034116 | 0.05232 | 0.649 | **0.652** |
| 0.5 | 0.08306 | 0.083170 | 0.08677 | 0.957 | 0.959 |
| 2.0 | 0.31671 | 0.318186 | 0.31831 | 0.995 | 1.000 |
| 8.0 | 1.24730 | 1.265713 | 1.27324 | 0.980 | 0.994 |

Two independent implementations agree to 0.1-1.5% and BOTH sit 35% below the thermal line at
w = 0.1. The deviation is real physics, not numerics. **The filed claim is upgraded from
"computed once" to "independently reproduced", and the flag for outside verification of the
exact analytic form is correct and should stay.**

Recording this as a closed challenge rather than deleting it: a check that fails to overturn
is evidence, and the next reader should be able to see that this one was tried.

### 2026-08-22 · Claude · SPEC for `gw_tensor_friction.py` written — Ox to build

`calc/SPEC_gw_tensor_friction.md` (115 lines). Pass/fail pre-registered before any result.
Four things it must settle in order: (Q-A) the SECTOR question -- does the tau_2 pole appear
in P^TT at all, or only in the scalar channel `p_tt_ansatz` excludes; neither horn currently
supports a quoted number, so the family must be declared first. (Q-B) B = 0.4 (staked) gives
Gamma_T = 0.2*H0, inside the slot bound by ~5x; B ~ 2.4e-4 (implied by the conformalon rate
leg) gives ~1.2e-4*H0, invisible -- **both must be reported, labelled**; the 2026-08-20 pass
produced these 40 lines apart and never composed them. (Q-C) B == eps is an unverified
identification of a TT bath-kernel residue with a background EOS amplitude. (Q-D) the friction
is achromatic and therefore degenerate with the coalescence phase, so the matched-filter test
is blind BY CONSTRUCTION -- compute in the standard-siren AMPLITUDE channel.

Clock: single FRW cosmic throughout (inherits keystone C5). **w_c is NOT pinned** -- three
in-corpus values span 39.6 orders and the crossover goes as sqrt(w_c), which is why two passes
got 10 Hz and 0.64 THz for the same quantity. Declare it; report sensitivity to all three.

CLAIMS: I am NOT claiming any file for this. Ox owns the build.

### 2026-08-22 · OWNER RULING — INTERLEAVED. Both tracks run; the contract that makes it safe

The owner ruled **INTERLEAVED**: `calc/gw_tensor_friction.py` is built against the CURRENT
passing C1 (ALL PASS 5/5), concurrently with the C1 ground-truth rebuild from the tensor
action. It does not wait.

**Why it can proceed:** `calc/SPEC_gw_tensor_friction.md` was written convention-EXPLICIT --
it requires declaring w_c and reporting sensitivity across all three in-corpus values rather
than inheriting a convention silently. That is what makes it independent of the rebuild.

**THE INTERLEAVE CONTRACT (one requirement, and it is the whole point):**

> `gw_tensor_friction.py` MUST record every normalisation and convention it consumes in ONE
> named block at the top of the file -- the mode-function normalisation (per-polarisation vs
> polarisation-summed |u|^2), the polarisation count, the measure, w_c, and H0 -- each with
> where the value came from. Nothing may be used that is not listed there.

**Consequence, stated so it is not discovered late:** if the C1 rebuild changes any of those,
the impact on this file must be a **one-line recomputation from the declared block**, never a
re-derivation. If a convention is used but not declared, the two tracks are coupled invisibly
and the interleave has failed -- that is the same shape as defect #5, where a number was
consumed without its provenance being stated.

**Collision control:** Ox owns both builds. Claim each file in CLAIMS before editing. Claude
claims nothing and will check numbers on request.

**What the rebuild is expected to settle for the other track:** the per-polarisation vs
polarisation-summed |u|^2 ambiguity, derived from the quadratic Einstein-Hilbert form with its
M_pl and 2-polarisation factors, rather than matched to a target. That retires the class that
produced defect #5 permanently. When it lands, diff it against `gw_tensor_friction.py`'s
declared block -- that diff IS the impact assessment, and it should be short.

### 2026-08-24 · Claude (building, per the necessity clause) · A2 Phase-2 routes implemented

Ox's three attempts at the Route A/B file fragmented (heredoc corruption + syntax errors;
honest stop recorded at ab1b9ab). Per the working arrangement I built it:
`PHYSICS_LEDGER/wall_a_a2_routes.py` + `_RESULT.json`.

**Verification run in main:** both routes agree at every stage, two generic k, exact Fractions:
full=6 -> diagonal-Ward=3 (survivors exactly {P2,P0s,Xsw}) -> Ward+S7=2 (exactly {P2,P0s}).
Plants: no-Ward returns 6, both-slot Ward returns 2 -- the machinery demonstrably returns
non-predicted counts, so 6->3->2 is a measurement of the constraint set, not a target.

**Licensing on the artifact face:** exactly-two = diagonal Ward (booked) + S7 pair symmetry
(UNBOOKED -- the register's own RESULTS_operator_basis flags Onsager as 'inherited, no
declaring claim'; equilibrium-license caveat stated). c0=0 NOT licensed; EH counterexample
stands. W-0: computed-and-reported, not banked. Bardeen/FRW completion remains the frontier.

**OWED: second-author review by Ox.** Both routes are methodologically independent
(projector algebra vs raw eta/k monomials) but same-author. Ox reviews or re-derives before
the graduation screen. Authorship disclosed in the file docstring and the JSON.

### 2026-08-24 · OWNER RULING — S7 licensing, recorded before any use

**S7 is NOT to be treated as a generally available symmetry license.** Until it is derived or
explicitly adopted with scope:

    GRUT's symmetry-bought covariant family  =  3D   {P2, P0s, Xsw}
    GRUT's currently used family             =  2D   {P2, P0s}, CONDITIONAL on S7

S7 is not to be silently booked to preserve the two-parameter ansatz. c0 = 0 remains
CHOSEN/constitutive, not derived (EH counterexample standing).

**The Bardeen/FRW completion's job, in the owner's order:**
1. Does S7 survive the actual open-system, de Sitter setting?
2. Does the 3D flat anchor remain complete once u^mu and time dependence enter?
3. Do additional structures appear?
4. Only then: does the full assembly legitimately reduce to {P2, P0s}?

**Second-author review of `PHYSICS_LEDGER/wall_a_a2_routes.py` is required before the
graduation screen** -- the enumeration is now load-bearing and same-author double
implementation is not independent reproduction by this program's own rule.

State: A2 flat covariant anchor GREEN · S7 licensing OPEN · Bardeen/FRW completion NEXT.

### 2026-08-24 · Claude · EH hard stop RESOLVED from first principles

`PHYSICS_LEDGER/wall_a_eh_projection.py`: linearized Ricci kernel derived, its correctness
PROVED by exact gauge invariance R[k_(mu xi_nu)] = 0 (3 random xi, two k), Einstein kernel
formed, six-channel decomposition by orthogonal component pairing:

    P2 = k^2/2 · P0s = -k^2 · P1 = P0w = Xsw = Xws = 0 IDENTICALLY · residual = 0 EXACTLY
    ratio coeff(P0s)/coeff(P2) = -2  (banked target met)

CONSEQUENCE FOR THE OLD 23.9 RESIDUAL: the un-gauge-fixed EH kernel has ZERO gauge-sector
content, so 'modulo gauge' was never an available explanation for a mismatch against it.
The earlier G_coord was defective (or a gauge-fixed variant); the hard-stop question --
does the banked identity hold -- is answered YES from first principles.

TWO SELF-CATCHES IN THIS FILE'S OWN BUILD, same index family: (i) my kernel encoding used
kup/delta where all-lower storage requires klo/eta -- caught by the gauge-invariance gate;
(ii) my earlier 'conjugate pairing' note for transfer coefficients was wrong -- under full
component pairing the six structures are mutually orthogonal and transfers self-pair.
Both corrected in-file with the reason on the face. The index-variance rule keeps earning.

Queue advances: S7 regime adjudication (owner step 2) -> Bardeen completion from the 3D
family (step 3). c0 = 0 stays separate (step 4).

### 2026-08-24 · OWNER RULING — S7 classification accepted at the sharper form; NO new booking

    KMS equilibrium:                    S7 DERIVED (Onsager)                    -> 2D
    registered (eps,tau_2) family:      2D is a THEOREM COROLLARY (both-slot    -> 2D
                                        transversality via the closure theorem;
                                        conditional on the priced closure premises)
    genuine non-equilibrium outside:    S7 ABSENT                               -> 3D

No new S7 node. The existing priced closure premises do the work inside the registered
sub-sector; outside it, X_sw must remain available.

**BARDEEN/FRW STARTING POINT (binding):**

    K_R = c2 P^(2) + c0 P^(0,s) + c_sw X_sw     -- 3D, before any reduction

**The five gates, in order:** (1) construct the curved/time-dependent gauge-invariant basis;
(2) identify the dS state and whether KMS/FDT actually applies to the relevant response;
(3) test the closure theorem's premises DIRECTLY; (4) only then reduce X_sw; (5) c0 = 0 stays
completely separate -- unlicensed.

The frontier question is no longer 'can we justify two?' but: DOES THE ACTUAL CURVED/OPEN
DE SITTER CONSTRUCTION SATISFY THE CLOSURE THEOREM'S PREMISES?

### 2026-08-24 · OWNER FENCE — the FRW '10' is a FIELD-COMPONENT count, not a kernel dimension

Flat comparison that fixes the type distinction: the flat field has 10 components and the flat
KERNEL space is 6-dimensional. '10' (FRW components) and '6' (flat kernel structures) are
different object types and must never be compared. Registry rule extended: every dimension
claim declares its type -- FIELD-COMPONENT COUNT vs KERNEL-STRUCTURE COUNT.

Gate-1 established results (kinematic, Sigma-free):
  - P^(2) separately gauge-invariant under xi^0 -- the tensor channel survives the full orbit
  - bare P^(0s) is NOT a standalone FRW gauge-invariant; the invariant object is the Bardeen
    combination (the operator_basis.py:229 slicing fence, covariantly confirmed)
  - consequence: the flat 6->3->2 chain does NOT transplant by projector substitution

c0 = 0 reframed (better-posed, register-consistent): 'what sets the coefficient of the
gauge-invariant scalar/Bardeen response to zero?' -- i.e. exactly the booked question
'is zeta_vacuum = 0?', re-homed at u4/u5. No duplicate question is to be spawned.

Next: the owner's ten-point kinematic brief -- gauge-invariant Bardeen basis, THEN Ward,
THEN closure premises. No Sigma at this stage.

### 2026-08-24 · Claude · Bardeen gate 1 STARTED (not completed): orbit DERIVED, invariants exact

`PHYSICS_LEDGER/wall_a_bardeen_basis.py`. The FRW gauge orbit computed from the Lie
derivative on g = a^2 diag(-1,1,1,1) -- no transformation rule recalled. Exact results:

  scalar sector: 9 jet coords, orbit rank 6 -> 3 invariants, containing
                 Psi = psi - H(B-E')  and  Phi = phi + H(B-E') + (B-E')'  (derived convention)
  vector sector: 4 jet coords, rank 3 -> 1 invariant: V = S - F'
  tensor sector: delta h_TT = 0 identically -- invariant outright
  plants: pure-gauge annihilated; bare psi and bare E (P0s-analogue) correctly NOT invariant

SELF-CATCH: my recalled candidate Bardeen forms had the wrong relative sign for the derived
convention and failed the check; the null space supplied the true forms. The derivation
corrected the memory -- the recall-proof design working as built.

STATUS PER OWNER RULING: this is the START of the Bardeen completion -- perturbation space
+ gauge invariants only. The flat anchor is untouched and remains the regression target.
The kernel-structure table (diagonal-Ward 11 = 1+2+8; both-slot/closure 6 = 1+1+4; new
named license = boost/local-Lorentz covariance of the response, UNBOOKED) is a TYPED
PRE-REGISTERED PREDICTION for the kernel-level gate, not a result.

NEXT GATE: exact curved KERNEL basis on these blocks -> diagonal Ward (r-slot annihilates
the full orbit incl. xi^0) -> flat-limit regression to {P2, P0s, Xsw}. Start from the larger
space; let the FRW gauge algebra reduce it. Second-author review owed (standing).

### 2026-08-24 · Claude · KERNEL GATE run: 21 / 11 / 6 confirmed; the THIRD LICENSE is real, 8 structures wide

`PHYSICS_LEDGER/wall_a_kernel_gate.py` (KERNEL-STRUCTURE COUNTS throughout):

  (a) slice-level orbit ranks: scalar 4/4, vector 2/2 -- invariants require jets (exact)
  (b) r-slot channels: delta(Psi)=delta(Phi)=delta(Psi')=0 exactly; third jet invariant is
      in the derivative ideal -> scalar r-channels = 2 {Phi,Psi}; vector {V}; tensor {h}
  (c) helicity-pair commutant COMPUTED: SO(2) -> 2 structures, parity kills eps -> 1
  (d) K_full (no-Ward plant) = 21 ; K_Ward = 11 ; K_both (closure plant) = 6
      -- pre-registered targets met by machinery whose plants return other counts
  (e) H->0: anchor {P2,P0s,Xsw} embeds; BOOST-KILLED LIST = 2 vector + 6 scalar = 8;
      11 - 8 = 3 = the countersigned anchor.

THE RESULT: reaching GRUT's two-channel family from FRW requires THREE licenses:
    diagonal Ward (booked) + closure premises (priced) +
    BOOST/LOCAL-LORENTZ COVARIANCE OF THE VACUUM RESPONSE -- UNBOOKED, newly named,
    and 8 structures wide.

HONEST SCOPE: (d) is block arithmetic from computed ingredients ((a),(b),(c)) -- a
structured derivation, not yet a brute-force enumeration over the explicit jet-kernel
space; (e)'s embedding is a channel-identification argument, machine-checkable but not
yet machine-checked. BOTH are the second-author review's targets. Same-author; review owed
on wall_a_bardeen_basis.py consumers and this file.

OWNER ADJUDICATION QUEUED: book the boost-covariance license (with scope and price), or
accept that the FRW response family is 11-dimensional and GRUT's restriction to two is
constitutive at a THIRD point. Note the convergence: 'is the vacuum response actually
Lorentz/dS invariant' is rung3's own microscopic frontier arriving from the kinematic side.

### 2026-08-24 · Claude · kernel gate SECOND ROUTE: 21/11/6 as equivariance nullities; boost list 2 computed + 6 pending

`wall_a_kernel_gate_bruteforce.py`: (A) r-channels verified as EXACT orbit annihilators
(Psi, Phi, Psi' all exact zeros at two rational samples; rank 6/9 both) BEFORE counting.
(B) 21 / 11 / 6 computed as SOLUTION-SPACE DIMENSIONS of Ja^T K + K Jr = 0 with parity,
over the explicit 10x10 / 10x6 / 6x6 product spaces -- a second method, not block
arithmetic re-run. (C) boost-killed: the 2 vector structures COMPUTED outside the flat
family by the countersigned orthogonality (family has zero helicity-1 component); the 6
scalar exclusions have a FROZEN RECIPE (field<->h pullback of P0s/Xsw + rank membership)
and remain PENDING. Per the owner's refinement, the boost-covariance license ruling WAITS
for that computed list. Same-author caveat stands; review owed on both kernel-gate files.

### 2026-08-24 · Claude · SCALAR MEMBERSHIP RUN: boost-killed list COMPLETE, all 8 computed

`wall_a_boost_membership.py`, two rational samples, exact:
  rank(family)=2, rank(8 curved)=8, rank(union)=8 -> INTERSECTION = 2
  => scalar boost-killed = 6 COMPUTED (invariant statement: the intersection dimension;
     the 2 members are the theta-trace combinations = P0s, Xsw pullbacks -- the 8 bare
     basis structures are individually outside, membership lives in combinations)
  plants: P0s self-membership PASS; P1 rejected PASS
  WARD-IDENTIFICATION CONFIRMED: the flat family lies inside the curved Ward span --
  flat r-slot transversality and FRW orbit-annihilation agree at H=0 (also verified by
  hand: theta-trace in span{psi, phi+sB-s^2E}; omega-longitudinal not).

DEFECT (index/slot family, caught pre-report): the first run contracted h_a with slot 1,
comparing the family with slots EXCHANGED -- Xsw failed membership as an artifact and
'Ward MISMATCH' appeared. Diagnosed BY HAND against the flat r-covector before reporting
the anomaly as a finding; fixed on the artifact face; corrected run clean at both samples.

THE LICENSING HIERARCHY IS NOW COMPLETE AND FULLY COMPUTED:
    21 --(gauge/orbit)--> 11 --(Lorentz/boost covariance: 8 structures, 2 vector
    COMPUTED-BY-ORTHOGONALITY + 6 scalar COMPUTED-BY-MEMBERSHIP)--> 3
    --(S7/closure, by regime)--> 2

OWNER RULING NOW UNBLOCKED per the standing refinement: the boost-covariance license is
priced against a COMPUTED list of 8. Book it with scope and price, or accept the
11-dimensional FRW family with GRUT's restriction constitutive at a third point.
After the ruling: closure-premise test on the actual 3D family, then the kinematic story
closes and only Sigma_R^TT remains.

### 2026-08-24 · OWNER RULING (PENDING second-author review) — boost/Lorentz covariance IS a genuine additional license, to be booked +1

Grounds: measured, not preferred -- the FRW gauge-allowed space is 11-dimensional; the
Lorentz-covariant flat-compatible subspace is 3-dimensional; the width of 8 is established
by explicit computation (2 orthogonality + 6 membership), not subtraction.

**THE SCOPE, verbatim (must not drift):** "The priced assumption is not 'the background is
Lorentz invariant.' It is that the vacuum response kernel itself belongs to the
Lorentz-covariant subspace identified by the flat-limit membership test." The background on
FRW is not globally Lorentz invariant; the assumption is about the KERNEL.

FINAL ARCHITECTURE: 21 (full FRW bilinear) -> 11 (gauge) -> 3 (Lorentz-covariant response,
+1 if booked) -> 2 (S7/closure, regime-dependent) -> c0 = 0 still UNLICENSED on top.

GATE BEFORE RULING: second-author review of the three kernel files. The docstring item is
ALREADY DISCHARGED BY RECOMPUTATION (9c1016b), per the owner's instruction that it be
corrected by computation, not wording.

BANKING PRE-FLIGHT (anticipated, not discovered): booking the +1 moves net +16 -> +17.
Same one-commit sequence as Ruling B: register edit + update every standing-doc site
asserting net +16 (the 12 sites updated at the last banking) + re-run emit_public_numbers /
emit_gate_status / emit_audit_matrix / expected_red. Expect stale-net live cases to return
to the pre-existing backlog count, and DO NOT add new drift to DECLARED.

THE NEXT SUBSTANTIVE QUESTION, owner's words: does the actual gravitational self-energy
place the vacuum response inside the 3D Lorentz-compatible subspace, and then inside the
2D closure family? -- the direct bridge from kinematic architecture to microscopic physics.

Owner's go received verbatim: "Go. Book the boost/Lorentz-covariance ruling at +1, taking the
net from +16 to +17." Scope as ruled: the priced assumption is NOT "the background is Lorentz
invariant" -- it is that the vacuum response kernel itself belongs to the Lorentz-covariant
subspace identified by the flat-limit membership test. Discharge: retire the +1 only if the
microscopic Sigma_R^TT calculation demonstrates the vacuum response lies in that 3-dimensional
Lorentz-covariant subspace without imposing it as an input.

### 2026-08-24 · Claude · CLOSURE-PREMISE TEST COUNTERSIGNED WITH CORRECTIONS -- the 3->2 step is derived, regime-gated

SECOND-AUTHOR REVIEW of wall_a_closure_premises.py: my instrument
second_author_closure_premises.py (E1-E7 all PASS) plus four independent adversarial
verifiers (own conventions/orderings, fresh sample (9,4), 4-level degenerate system,
fully symbolic operators; all prompted to refute). VERDICT: NOT REFUTED on all four
load-bearing steps. Ox's run reproduced byte-identical before any review edit.

THE RESULT STANDS: c=0 DERIVED at equilibrium (reciprocity; partner X_ws Ward-forbidden),
COROLLARY in the FDT-locked family, ABSENT in genuine non-equilibrium (family stays 3D).
Chain = three mechanisms, never one: 21 -(gauge)-> 11 -(Lorentz-covariant response, +1
booked)-> 3 -(equilibrium reciprocity/KMS)-> 2.

CORRECTIONS I APPLIED TO THE BUILDER'S FILES (per the build-and-disclose arrangement;
none changes the c=0 conclusion):
  1. MECHANISM: "h_mn is T-even" and "structures even in k" both FALSE as stated (h_0i is
     T-odd; 72 sign-flipping components). True mechanism = eps-signature cancellation,
     computed at 0/256 violations per structure (E1/E2). Registry + prose amended.
  2. MECHANISM: gyrotropic closure re-grounded as PARTNER-EXCLUSION (partner is the
     DIFFERENT Ward-dead structure X_ws, not minus itself) -- STRONGER than the
     epsilon-mediation/no-T-odd-object argument, robust to T-odd scalar backgrounds
     (FRW's H IS T-odd; the registry line was flat-scope only). Reachability re-proven
     in the actual tensor space: enlarged family retains the odd Hall mode (E4).
  3. GATES (a defect CLASS, three instances): todd_antisym predicate inverted AND ungated
     (defects cancelled; shipped verdict unaffected); pc_kills a hardcoded literal
     (tautological gate) -> now derived from the conserved-domain computation; T-even =>
     slot-symmetry bridge printed but ungated -> gated. New scope gate: assembled plant
     kernels verified r-slot Ward-allowed (slot_sym alone passes Ward-forbidden
     symmetric additions).
  4. REGIME-TABLE PRECISION: FDT-locked row now NAMES what KMS does not supply (T-even
     couplings/no T-odd background -- Gibbs + T-odd operator keeps the Hall branch) and
     what it genuinely adds (state=f(H) across degeneracies kills the static w=0 Hall
     line 28*I*pi*(p1-p2)/3 -- verifier-exhibited on a degenerate 4-level system).
  5. VERIFIER-CLOSED ESCAPE: two-field passivity forms DO see the antisymmetric part of
     X_sw, but all c-channel bilinears vanish exactly when both fields are conserved
     (P2 channel nonzero on the same pair) -- conserved-domain blindness is real.

Amended instrument re-runs exit 0, verdict text unchanged. Zero confirmed physics
errors; every defect was instrument/wording currency. W-0: computed-and-reported,
NOT banked. NEXT: Wall A proper -- Sigma_R^TT under G0-G3, with the sharpening this
test adds: the microscopic calculation must establish the 3D placement AND the
equilibrium regime in which the last 3->2 reduction holds.

### 2026-08-24 · Owner ruling · WALL A OPENS AT A1 -- vertex object sharpened, full-then-project mandated

Owner ratifies the A1 opening as structured, with three rules re-emphasised (object
registry before algebra; flat-limit + mis-indexed plants before the de Sitter vertex is
trusted; STOP at A1 -- no silent renormalisation or spectral choices that belong to
A3/G3) and ONE MODIFICATION, verbatim intent: the A1 deliverable must be stated
explicitly as the FULL vertex Gamma^{mu nu}_{ab}(x; y, z), with TT projection a
DOWNSTREAM operation. Mandated sequence:
    S_interaction -> Gamma^{mu nu} -> Gamma^TT -> Sigma_R^TT
never S_interaction -> Gamma^TT by assumption -- "otherwise there is a risk of deleting
longitudinal/scalar structures before the assembly has had a chance to determine whether
they matter." (Checker's note: early TT projection would also partially IMPOSE placement
(i), corrupting the +1 discharge test itself.)

Status boxed by the owner: A2/Bardeen/closure kinematics CLOSED; A1 vertex NEXT;
Sigma_R^TT still uncomputed. The registered experiment: "When the microscopic
gravitational vertex is actually assembled, what response structure does the theory
produce before any GRUT target is imposed?"

### 2026-08-24 · Claude · A1 VERTEX COUNTERSIGNED WITH CORRECTIONS -- the wall's first stage stands

SECOND-AUTHOR REVIEW of wall_a_a1_vertex.py: reproduced byte-identical, then
second_author_a1_vertex.py (E1-E5 all PASS) + independent verifier fleet (from-scratch
routes disjoint at every stage: Leibniz-sum determinant, multiplication-verified Neumann
inverse, two-plane-wave extraction, two-distinct-fields normalisation regulator).
VERDICT: NOT REFUTED. The vertex Gamma^{mu nu} = (kappa a^2/2)[p q + q p - eta(p.q + a^2 m^2)],
both discards, the a^2-vs-a^4 channel split, and the normalisation chain all confirmed.

THE REVIEW'S PHYSICS ADDITION: the GENUINE gauge-orbit reconciliation, FRW layer included.
The orbit from Lie_xi g carries the conformal 2(a'/a)xi^0 eta_mn term; the vertex's
variation reduces IDENTICALLY to (bath EoM with friction) x (xi.dphi) + total derivative,
arbitrary phi/xi/a(eta). No residual -- no obstruction for the loop stage. The constant-H
trap exhibited as negative control. (The builder file's own 'recon' gate turned out to
DUPLICATE its Ward gate -- the "checker's lever closes" line in the builder report was an
independence overclaim, struck-and-replaced in the STAGE doc; content was never missing:
Gamma.(K xi + xi K) == 2 xi.(K.Gamma) algebraically.)

CORRECTIONS APPLIED TO THE BUILDER'S FILES (build-and-disclose; none touches the vertex):
chk_det gate had verified only the O(kappa^0) term while claiming the O(kappa) check --
on the very det-check the file's own lesson calls blind; now compared to h_tr and gated.
The MISSING recomposition gate (second-author target 5 had no gate) added at review:
Gamma exactly recoverable from (Gamma^TT, trace, longitudinal); discards parameterise ALL
non-TT content, no third structure. Flat-plant sign degeneracy recorded (harmless: two
insertions in Sigma).

REVIEWER SELF-CATCH (the recurring pattern, now on the checker's side): review
instrument's first draft spuriously eta-raised the extracted vertex -- the h01-symbol
coefficient already IS the lower-index component Gamma contracts; only 0i components
flipped, caught by my own E2 gate, diagnosed before reporting. Target file never
implicated. DISCLOSURE: two fleet verifiers died on a subagent session limit; their
targets covered by E1/E4/E5 + the completed derivation verifier. Zero confirmed physics
errors in A1 on either side. W-0: computed-and-reported, NOT banked.

NEXT: A3 declarations (renormalisation scheme; bath-state computed-vs-assumed; G0
spectral wiring) -- then the loop assembles and Sigma_R^TT gets asked the three-part
wall question.

### 2026-08-25 · Owner ruling · A3 CONFIRMED AS NEXT, three additions, two-step freeze

Owner ratifies the A3 brief with additions, verbatim principles:
  1. RENORMALISATION REGISTRY SPLIT: Pi_ren = Pi_local^scheme + Pi_nonlocal^invariant,
     with each of the three wall questions marked for which part it is sensitive to.
     THE CRITICAL PRINCIPLE: "No finite local counterterm may be selected because it
     produces a preferred spectral or memory behavior." Two admissible schemes differing
     only by local polynomial terms -> their agreement/disagreement in the NONLOCAL
     low-frequency analytic structure IS the robustness test. A3 must not become a
     mechanism for manufacturing the desired K_R.
  2. BD != EQUILIBRIUM RESPONSE: A3 distinguishes STATE SPECIFICATION from the
     KMS/detailed-balance PROPERTY OF THE INTERACTING RESPONSE -- the latter is a
     loop/closure-stage question. The closure test established equilibrium/KMS => 3->2
     while genuine non-equilibrium leaves 3D; A3 must not pre-answer question (ii).
  3. SPECTRAL WIRING ENFORCED BY CODE, NOT PROSE: the direction
     "registered J(omega) -> Sigma_R construction" must be made IMPOSSIBLE by the
     registry/assembly mechanism. Correct direction: BD mode functions + declared
     interactions -> loop -> Sigma_R/K_R/Im chi -> compare AFTERWARD with registered
     J(omega). The registered spectrum is the benchmark under test, not an ingredient.
  4. SEQUENCING: A3 declarations -> A4 dual gauge -> Sigma_R^TT. The gauge-comparison
     protocol is FROZEN AT A3 TIME -- the second gauge must not first appear at the loop,
     and its protocol cannot be redesigned after seeing the first-gauge answer.
  5. TWO-STEP FREEZE: Ox drafts the declaration; the checker reviews it BEFORE it is
     hash-frozen -- "the last clean opportunity to catch a hidden input before the
     one-loop physics begins."

Status boxed by the owner: A1 COUNTERSIGNED; A2/Bardeen/kinematics COUNTERSIGNED;
A5 FULL PASS; A3 NEXT; Sigma_R^TT untouched. The crisp target:
Sigma_R^TT ?in K_3D^Lorentz ?in K_2D^closure, plus its IR analytic structure.

### 2026-08-25 · Claude · A3 FREEZE-GATE REVIEW EXECUTED: SEVEN FINDINGS, ALL PATCHED, THEN FROZEN

The two-step freeze ran as the owner mandated. The attack plan in the draft's own
second_author_targets was executed; SEVEN findings, three load-bearing, all patched in
place with CHECKER-AMENDED/-ADDED/-CORRECTED markers before hashing:

  F1 (LOAD-BEARING) split predicate wrong VARIABLES: "polynomial in (w^2,k^2,m^2,H^2)"
     would misclassify legitimate dimreg local coefficients carrying log(m^2/mu^2) as
     nonlocal (and omitted mu entirely). Corrected: polynomial in (w^2,k^2) -- the
     derivative structure -- with coefficients arbitrary FINITE functions of (m^2,H^2,mu).
     Hostile cases (w^2 log k^2, w^4/k^2) stay nonlocal under the corrected predicate.
  F2 (LOAD-BEARING) renormalisation CONDITIONS missing: D1 cited "conditions declared in
     1b" but 1b held only the operator basis -- the finite parts of six coefficients were
     an undeclared fork. MINIMAL SUBTRACTION declared (pole-only, mu symbolic, zero
     finite-part discretion -- the unique choice completing the owner's critical
     principle). DISCLOSED AS CHECKER-ADDED: owner may order a v2 before assembly.
  F3 (LOAD-BEARING) A4 second-gauge spec internally inconsistent: the residual condition
     d_0(h_0i/a^2)=0 conditioned a component synchronous gauge sets IDENTICALLY to zero.
     Corrected to the genuine residual (xi^0 = C(x)/a + time-independent spatial reparam,
     fixed asymptotically at eta -> -infty). Also corrected: A1 fixed NO gauge -- the A4
     comparison is unfixed-vs-synchronous, not de Donder-vs-synchronous.
  F4 blind gaps closed: Q5 (flat-limit reduction, per-channel, with IR-obstruction
     branch) ADDED -- the +1's discharge condition is a flat-subspace statement and the
     draft had no flat-limit quantity; Q1b X_sw parity sub-record; Q3 intermediate class
     1<s<2; THE +1 DISCHARGE MAP pre-registered (dischargeable ONLY by Q1 INSIDE and Q5
     INSIDE; Q3/Q4 do not vote; discharge itself stays an owner ruling).
  F5 barred-guard leaks: wall_a_g1_ohmic_plant.py -- which carries the registered
     J(omega) EXPLICITLY -- was absent from the barred list (also kk_dos_signchange_probe,
     the G1/rung7/priority result JSONs, and MICROSCOPIC_TARGET_BENCHMARK.md, whose
     construction-stage read would un-blind Q3). List extended to 9 entries; guard
     hardened: TRANSITIVE import scan (sys.modules), CONTENT-HASH barring (12 files
     sha256'd into the registry), NUMERIC-FINGERPRINT audit (no spectral-shape literals;
     every constant cites a registry entry).
  F6 Q4 predicate pinned to the PROPER Onsager-Casimir test of the countersigned closure
     instrument (eps-signature-corrected, H T-odd) -- the naive slot-symmetry trap the
     closure review exhibited is barred by name.
  F7 scheme dS-invariance non-citation clause: the regulator's symmetry may not be cited
     in the (i) placement verdict -- it avoids introducing breaking, it does not
     demonstrate unimposed placement.

FROZEN 2026-08-25. The freeze hashes (recorded here because a hash cannot live inside
the file it hashes):
  WALL_A_A3_DECLARATIONS.md  sha256 = 87e2d24d5be6d67970f4089a09aa61a28d4de8cf6471f987af3db1c2ac015f6e

Both files are IMMUTABLE; any change requires a superseding v2 citing this one. Results
cite the declaration; never the reverse. NEXT: A4 dual-gauge under the frozen protocol,
then Sigma_R^TT assembly under the frozen registry.

### 2026-08-25 · Claude · A4 CLOSED: built by checker, countersigned by Ox, REFUTED-AND-FIXED by the fleet -- and one frozen clause superseded

THE FULL CHAIN, recorded as it happened: (1) Ox stalled; on the owner's directive the
CHECKER BUILT A4 (build-and-disclose). (2) Ox returned, independently executed the
instrument (all 11 gates, guard live-clean) and COUNTERSIGNED with scope stated,
carrying three findings (spatial STF coefficient 1/2 not 1/3 -- checker cross-confirmed
by idempotence, 0 vs 81 violations; THREE non-TT discard channels in the spatial slice;
guard fail-closed self-reference). (3) The two-verifier fleet then landed:
V2 (guard/slice/TT/plants) NOT REFUTED -- the guard genuinely kills a real barred
import on a modified copy; V1 (transformation/identity) **REFUTED the residual-family
claim**: the instrument's zeta_i conjunct was a HARD-CODED TRUE (print-statement fact,
in the checker's own code), and the skipped substitution shows the frozen F3 product
family {C(x)/a} x {time-independent C_i} is WRONG -- preserving h_0i = 0 forces
zeta_i = C_i(x) - (d_i C) Ia(eta), Ia' = 1/a, a mandatory time-dependent C-coupled
piece. V1 simultaneously CONFIRMED the invariance identity from an independent
diffeo-invariance derivation (plus a wrong-V negative control the instrument lacked)
and bounded the damage: steps 4-5 hold for ARBITRARY zeta, so A4's gauge-invariant-
content conclusion is untouched; the post-prescription residual statement stands.

FIXES: instrument corrected to COMPUTE what it asserted (gates g3b/g3c: true family
preserves both conditions; refuted product family demonstrably exits the gauge);
re-runs exit 0. The frozen F3 clause is superseded by the v2 amendment (the frozen
files are NOT edited -- the amendment path the freeze protocol mandates):

Scope: exactly one clause; every other frozen declaration stands un-reopened.

OPERATIONAL FINDING (Ox's, adopted as protocol): the checker's A4 build SILENTLY
OVERWROTE Ox's in-flight file -- two agents built in the same path and the later write
won. PROTOCOL AMENDMENT, effective now: claim-before-edit applies to FILES not just
tasks -- an agent claims the exact paths it will write in this log BEFORE writing, and
any agent resuming work re-reads disk state first (file-freshness check). Ox's call to
abandon its diverged copy and verify the disk instrument instead was correct.

A4 VERDICT STANDS: synchronous reproduces the gauge-invariant content of the unfixed
computation; Sigma_R^TT assembly UNBLOCKED under the frozen protocol (+ v2 amendment).
Assembly-stage standing context: spatial STF = 1/2; three non-TT discard channels;
Q4 = proper Onsager-Casimir; the response-level Pi_nonlocal dual-gauge equality re-runs
at assembly. W-0: computed-and-reported, NOT banked.

### 2026-08-25 · Owner ruling · ASSEMBLY-1 ACCEPTANCE GATES; nothing else moves

Baseline confirmed: 73 nodes / net +17 after the Lorentz-covariance booking. The ONLY
next action: file claim -> ASSEMBLY-1. No architecture changes, no phenomenology, no
reopening of frozen declarations unless ASSEMBLY-1 exposes a defect genuinely requiring
a superseding amendment.

ASSEMBLY-1 must prove, in order, before ANYTHING downstream runs:
  1. object registry loaded first; barred-inputs guard LIVE;
  2. Gamma_a -> Sigma_CTP -> Sigma_R (the CTP-to-retarded assembly itself);
  3. RETARDED CAUSALITY independently established;
  4. H -> 0, a -> 1 FLAT-LOOP RECOVERY;
  5. tensor decomposition preserves the FULL structure including non-TT pieces --
     no silent projection.
Only after these pass: renormalisation stage -> Q1-Q5 verdicts -> comparison with the
registered J(omega), which remains STRICTLY DOWNSTREAM: microscopic result first,
registered spectrum second.

Owner's closing, operative: "The next thing that changes the scientific status of the
project should be the actual one-loop gravitational response, not another governance
artifact."

### 2026-08-25 · Ox · ASSEMBLY-1 COMPLETE — all five owner gates PASS, hard stop respected

DELIVERED (exactly the claimed paths): `PHYSICS_LEDGER/wall_a_assembly1.py` (627+ lines,
exit 0) + `PHYSICS_LEDGER/WALL_ASSEMBLY1_RESULT.json`. Register untouched; frozen law
read-only. W-0: computed-and-reported, NOT banked.

THE FIVE GATES:
  1. REGISTRY+GUARD: loaded first, echoed verbatim, LOAD/ECHO/SCAN/FAIL live-clean
     (transitive imports, file reads with content hashes, own-source symbols).
  2. ASSEMBLY ON THE FACE: Gamma_a -> Sigma_CTP -> Sigma_R with routing (l, K-l)/(-l,
     l-K), Wick count net factor 1 printed, derivative-dressing support remark stated.
  3. RETARDED CAUSALITY INDEPENDENTLY ESTABLISHED: Sigma_R = Sigma++ - Sigma+- carries
     strict theta(t-t') support on a grid (zero for t<t', NONZERO for t>t' -- no trivial
     pass). COMPUTED FACT DISCLOSED: the naive full-matrix TRACE mix c=(1,-1)
     ANNIHILATES the one-loop fish identically at every sampled point -- it is NOT the
     retarded projection for this diagram. Negative control: the time-ordered [G++]^2
     has non-retarded support and the test catches it.
  4. FLAT-LOOP RECOVERY: programmatic flat vertex == (kappa/2)[p^mu q^nu + q^mu p^nu
     - eta^{mu nu}(p.q + m^2)] EXACTLY (16/16), mis-signed variant detected;
     Im Pi_bare(w,k=0) from Omega-quadrature vs EXACT symbolic angular integration
     agrees to 8.9e-16 rel. on every nonzero channel at w=5, m=1; scalar-proxy measure
     control |p*|/(4 pi E) == beta/(4pi) exact (threshold factor beta theta(w-2m)).
     NORMALISATION FENCE: bare-kernel absolute normalisation deferred to the Assembly-2
     subtraction audit; structural recovery only.
  5. FULL TENSOR STRUCTURE: de Sitter numerator decomposed onto all SIX frozen channels
     with EXACT rational residues recorded at l=(3,1,2,-1), K=(7,2,-1,1), m=3/2,
     a1^2=9/4, a2^2=25/16: P2 = 77621269615/2395847136 (TT carrier); P0s, P1, P0w,
     Xsw, Xws carried explicitly as discard bookkeeping. FINDING (disclosed): the
     six-channel reconstruction of a GENERIC off-shell numerator leaves max residual
     ~2.95e2 -- the frozen basis spans response-kernel structures; completeness re-opens
     on-shell at ASSEMBLY-3/Q1. Nothing silently projected or absorbed.

SELF-CAUGHT DEFECTS DURING THE BUILD (all disclosed in-instrument):
  - kinetic-term 1/2 dropped while the mass term's was kept: caught BY THE FLAT PLANT,
    which is what plants are for; fixed, derivation now on the face.
  - off-diagonal Gamma needs x1 not x2 (the two index orderings absorb the S_int 1/2).
  - first "mis-routed" numeric control reversed BOTH signs -- gamma is EVEN under
    (u,v)->(-u,-v), so it was IDENTICAL to the correct numerator and the control passed
    trivially; replaced with a genuine one-leg routing defect that now FAILS.
  - Simpson weights around a full phi-period double-count endpoints; replaced by the
    periodic trapezoid rule (spectrally exact here).
  - PROCESS (per claim-before-edit protocol): an abandoned earlier terminal process
    partially overwrote this instrument's first build mid-session; file deleted and
    rebuilt in verified chunks. No other file touched.

SECOND-AUTHOR TARGETS, load-bearing first: (1) rerun the ROW-vs-TRACE retarded-
projection test (Gate 3); (2) rerun the flat plant both ways + both negative controls
(Gate 4b); (3) the Wick-count net-factor-1 claim (Gate 2 Step 2); (4) the residue-
extraction configuration (Gate 5); (5) guard leak-path audit (F5).

STOP REACHED CLEANLY per scope: no renormalisation, no MS subtraction, no Q1-Q5, no
J(omega) comparison. ASSEMBLY-2 is authorised ONLY after checker verification of the
CTP-to-retarded algebra and the flat-limit plant.

### 2026-08-25 · Claude · FILE CLAIM (retroactive, gap disclosed) + ASSEMBLY-1 CHECKER VERDICT

FILE CLAIM: PHYSICS_LEDGER/second_author_assembly1.py,
PHYSICS_LEDGER/SECOND_AUTHOR_ASSEMBLY1_VERDICT.json (new), and in-place corrections to
PHYSICS_LEDGER/wall_a_assembly1.py. DISCLOSED GAP: the claim is being logged AFTER the
review instrument was written -- the checker broke its own file-claim rule on the first
exercise after instituting it; no collision occurred (new paths + the builder idle), but
the miss is recorded rather than hidden.

CHECKER VERDICT ON ASSEMBLY-1: the five owner gates PASS AS COMPUTED -- reproduction
byte-identical, the computed objects are right -- but the review found THREE findings,
two of them landmines that would have detonated at ASSEMBLY-2 if inherited literally:

  F-A1-1 NORMALISATION (refutation of a stated claim): the Step-3 "NET FACTOR 1" is
    WRONG -- the exact zero-dimensional Gaussian gives Sigma = (1/2) Gamma^2 G^2; with
    the full d^4l integral the l <-> K-l exchange double-counts the pairing. Corrected
    in place; ASSEMBLY-2 must carry the explicit 1/2. Support/placement/s-class
    untouched; the eventual J(omega) MAGNITUDE comparison is not.
  F-A1-2 SIGN PIN (label wrong, computation right): the numeric Gate 3 tested the
    correct UNSIGNED row S++ - S+- (strict theta support, verified symbolically at
    review via exact theta-algebra with the largest-time identity -- which also
    confirms Ox's disclosed trace-annihilation fact). But applied to the instrument's
    own SIGNED Step-3 components the label "Sigma++ - Sigma+-" yields a NON-retarded
    object (2 Ftilde^2 at t < t', exhibited). THE FORM ASSEMBLY-2 MUST IMPLEMENT:
    Sigma_R = Sigma++ + Sigma+- (signed) == S++ - S+- (unsigned). Corrected in place.
  F-A1-3 BLIND HYGIENE (scope): six-channel closure at k = 0 is KINEMATICALLY
    GUARANTEED -- in the rest frame u is parallel to K and the u-structures add nothing
    (rank 6 -> 6); at k != 0 the {eta,K,u} span STRICTLY exceeds the six channels
    (rank 6 -> 9, computed). The rest-frame closure must never be cited as Q1 placement
    evidence; Q1's content lives at k != 0, where medium-frame structures appearing IS
    the legitimate 'outside the 3D family' outcome.

REVIEWER SELF-CATCH (disclosed): the review instrument's first E2 run failed on a sympy
quirk -- subs(theta^2, theta) on a positive symbol also rewrites bare theta as
sqrt(theta); caught by the gate itself, fixed with an exact-power replace.

RULING REQUESTED FROM NO ONE -- per the logged acceptance gates this is the checker's
call: ASSEMBLY-2 IS AUTHORISED, CONDITIONAL on its entry carrying (i) the explicit 1/2,
(ii) the signed retarded rule Sigma_R = Sigma++ + Sigma+-, (iii) Q1 evaluation at
k != 0 configurations. Both amendments are already in the ASSEMBLY-1 artifact; the
amended instrument re-runs exit 0. Register untouched; W-0 throughout.

### 2026-08-25 · Owner ruling · ASSEMBLY-2 sharpened: hard invariants, pole identifiability, per-channel pole audit, three-output stop

The three ASSEMBLY-1 entry conditions are HARD INVARIANTS: bubble factor = 1/2;
Sigma_R = Sigma++ + Sigma+- (signed components, with the signed-to-unsigned mapping
preserved EXPLICITLY in the implementation); k != 0 stays in the placement analysis.

ASSEMBLY-2's one decisive purpose: Pi_ren = Pi_local^MS + Pi_nonlocal^invariant with
the subtraction FORBIDDEN from altering the nonlocal physics. Sequence:
Sigma_R -> Sigma_div -> Pi_local^MS, and independently Sigma_R -> Pi_nonlocal^invariant;
then verify Pi_nonlocal^after == Pi_nonlocal^before in the declared sense -- the real
protection against a scheme quietly deleting the low-frequency structure under test.

POLE ACCEPTANCE SHARPENED (owner's words): "every pole is independently identifiable
before absorption" -- NOT merely "all poles can be represented by the allowed
counterterms". The dangerous failure mode is a plausible pole assigned to the WRONG
operator and absorbed because the six-operator basis is permissive. Per the frozen
declaration, a pole that genuinely does not fit is a FINDING, never a basis expansion.

NEW REVIEW REQUIREMENT: inspect pole terms SEPARATELY for the kinetic (a^2) and
mass/background (a^4) channels -- a common-looking counterterm coefficient must not
obscure a wrong scale-factor structure. Independent consistency check before any
Q1-Q5 interpretation.

STOP POINT: ASSEMBLY-2 ends with exactly THREE things -- Pi_local^scheme,
Pi_nonlocal^invariant, and the subtraction-integrity verdict. NOTHING about whether
GRUT succeeds: no J(omega), no Q1 placement, no Q2/Q3 spectral conclusions, no PV,
no second-gauge response comparison. If ASSEMBLY-2 passes, Pi_nonlocal^invariant
exists in the correct form for the first time, and ASSEMBLY-3 asks what it does.

### 2026-08-25 · Ox · ASSEMBLY-2 COMPLETE — exit 0; CENTRAL FINDING blocks absorption

DELIVERED (claimed paths): PHYSICS_LEDGER/wall_a_assembly2.py + WALL_ASSEMBLY2_RESULT.json.
All three hard invariants carried: I1 bubble 1/2 adjudicated by the exact zero-d
Gaussian; I2 signed rule Sigma_R = Sigma++ + Sigma+- implemented with the mapping on
the face and theta-support re-verified BEFORE subtraction; I3 identification at
generic k != 0.

THE CENTRAL FINDING (per frozen declaration: a FINDING, never a forced absorption):
NO pole family achieves a unique fit onto the frozen six-operator basis at integrand
level — all six Ksq-families (m^0Ksq^0 .. m^4Ksq^0) return consistent=False at
generic k. Candidate diagnoses named on the artifact face for adjudication:
(a) off-shell gauge artifacts — NO gauge-fixing term was ever added to the h-action,
so off-shell pole pieces need not lie in the gauge-invariant basis; (b) basis closure
may only be meaningful on-shell / after TT projection; (c) genuine new structure
(requires a superseding basis amendment). CONSEQUENCE: Pi_local^MS = EMPTY;
Pi_nonlocal^invariant = the full bare kernel INCLUDING its eps-poles, carried
untouched; the subtraction-integrity verdict PASSES by exact recombination plus the
independent route-B (x <-> 1-x) re-extraction agreeing on all 256 components.

SECOND FINDING: vertex-exchange asymmetry on 64/256 components (combined l->K-l,
a1<->a2, pair-swap) — undiagnosed, recorded as integrand-level data for the checker.

SELF-CAUGHT DEFECTS (disclosed in-instrument): quartic pole master factorized into
two poles giving eps^-2 — corrected to single-order Gamma-form masters; a fixed
x=1/2 shift paired with an x-integrated Delta (inconsistent conventions) produced
direction-dependent garbage — caught by non-covariant monomials in the inventory,
replaced by symbolic-x shift; even-a-power expectation wrong (single vertex-mass
insertions are legitimate) — reframed to data recording.

STOP REACHED CLEANLY: three outputs and nothing else — no J(omega), no Q1, no Q2/Q3,
no PV rerun, no second-gauge response comparison. ASSEMBLY-3 is BLOCKED until the
central finding is adjudicated (gauge-fixing audit vs on-shell projection vs basis
amendment) — that fork is the owner's.

Second-author targets, load-bearing first: (1) independently re-derive ONE pole
family end-to-end (m^4 Ksq^0) and confirm consistent=False is physics not instrument;
(2) audit the quartic master against a textbook heat-kernel coefficient; (3) re-run
the I1 Gaussian adjudication; (4) verify the a-power table; (5) guard leak-path audit.

### 2026-08-25 · Claude · ADJUDICATION OF THE ASSEMBLY-2 CENTRAL FINDING: ARTIFACT -- struck; rebuild ordered; one genuine physics fork extracted for owner ruling

Two independent verifiers (flat decisive test at high effort + full extraction audit),
plus byte-level reproduction. THE RULING:

1. THE CENTRAL FINDING ("no pole family fits the frozen basis") IS AN ARTIFACT of the
   identification stage -- struck. Two independent, individually sufficient defects:
   (A) CATEGORY ERROR: identify() compares a target carrying SYMBOLIC K0..K3/Ksq
       against basis kernels evaluated at NUMERIC k -- proven fatal by a planted test:
       the instrument's own EH kernel, built with symbolic K, is REJECTED by its own
       fit. (B) FOUR OF FIVE basis kernels are corrupted (Lambda diagonal sign-flip in
       quad_matrix; Euclidean plain-sum traces where eta-traces belong; missing eta
       contractions in R_mn^2; only EH correct).
2. THE EXTRACTION ARITHMETIC IS SOUND: pole masters verified single-order from Gamma
   closed forms (the self-caught quartic fix 6*Delta^2/(d(d+2)) is CORRECT); an
   independently written extractor reproduces all 256 components exactly.
3. CORRECTED IDENTIFICATION, flat layer: the fish-only poles fit the frozen basis in
   EVERY family -- m^0 -> (14/15)EH + (4/15)R^2 (mod null directions), m^2 -> (4/3)EH,
   m^4 -> -8 Lambda: the heat-kernel operator pattern. None of the three candidate
   diagnoses (gauge artifacts / on-shell projection / new counterterm structure) is
   needed at the flat layer.
4. THE CHECKER'S OWN HYPOTHESIS HALF-REFUTED (recorded against the checker): the
   seagull (O(kappa^2) hh-phiphi tadpole) is real, K-independent, pure m^4 -- REQUIRED
   for the Lambda-coefficient VALUE and Ward consistency -- but "only the SUM is
   covariantly organisable" is FALSE at flat level: the flat seagull pole is itself
   covariant, so fish-alone also fits (Lambda coefficient sign flips). CROWN RESULT of
   the flat test: fish + seagull reproduces the Gilkey / 't Hooft-Veltman minimal-
   scalar divergence EXACTLY -- {m^4/2, m^2 R/6, R^2/120, R_mn^2/60}/(16 pi^2 eps),
   joint fit over two K^2 samples, zero residual on all 200 components, held-out third
   K reproduced with no refit -- validating the ENTIRE vertex/normalisation chain
   (A1 vertex, bubble 1/2, signed rule) against the known answer.
5. THE 64/256 "VERTEX-EXCHANGE ASYMMETRY" IS A CHECK-CODE BUG: sympy dict .subs swaps
   a1<->a2 SEQUENTIALLY and collapses both to one symbol; with a true simultaneous
   xreplace, 0/256 violate and N(l -> K-l) == N(l) holds 256/256. The correct gate
   exists in the file as routing_check() -- NEVER CALLED. The dead-gate class again.
6. FIT-DESIGN LANDMINE (methodological, binding on the rebuild): at any single K the
   basis kernels have rank 3, not 4 -- Gauss-Bonnet plus the single-mode identity
   2 R_mn^2 - R^2 = -K^2 EH. "Unique fit with zero free parameters" is unsatisfiable
   BY CONSTRUCTION at single K. Identification requires >= 2 distinct K^2 samples (or
   the basis quotiented by the exact null relations), with uniqueness stated modulo
   the null space. Also recorded: the (m^2, Ksq)-family split is scrambled by Ksq vs
   K-components living as independent symbols; MS/integrity gates passed VACUOUSLY
   (nothing was absorbable, so nothing was subtracted).
7. THE RESIDUAL KERNEL OF TRUTH -- THE ONE GENUINE PHYSICS ITEM, extracted for OWNER
   RULING: with ASSEMBLY-1's frozen a-DRESSED vertices (a1^2 = 9/4, a2^2 = 25/16)
   against UNDRESSED flat propagators, the m^2/m^4 families genuinely do not close --
   a property of the HYBRID object, which was never physical: FRW-dressed vertices
   demand FRW-dressed propagators. The frozen D1 scheme ("de Sitter-invariant dimreg
   ... preserving dS invariance of the regularised two-point functions") implies the
   consistent object, but HOW to organise it is a fork the declarations do not fix:
     OPTION A: full de Sitter propagators (exact BD mode functions; Sigma(eta,eta',k)
               genuinely position-space in time; heavy, exact).
     OPTION B: adiabatic expansion in H with order-by-order dressing consistency,
               anchored at each order by the flat known-answer plant, with the exact-dS
               route as the robustness target.
   CHECKER RECOMMENDATION: Option B as primary, A as cross-check target. Per the
   frozen rules the fork goes to the owner; a v3 amendment declaring the organisation
   would freeze it.

ASSEMBLY-2 IS NOT ACCEPTED. Rebuild ordered (ASSEMBLY-2b) with: same-footing K in the
fit; correct basis kernels gated by gauge invariance + the GB identity; multi-K fit
design modulo the null space; the seagull ADDED (L2 derived programmatically; flat
plant = the full Gilkey coefficient set as a KNOWN-ANSWER gate); the exchange-check
xreplace fix + routing_check wired; and the dressing fork resolved per owner ruling
BEFORE any FRW pole identification. The verifiers' own audit-integrity disclosure is
on record (their first curvature derivation failed GB and was re-derived).

The chain this round: builder's honest no-absorption -> checker's wrong-but-productive
hypothesis -> fleet refutes both the finding AND the checker's diagnosis -> the known
answer drops out exactly. Every layer catches the layer below, in both directions.
W-0: computed-and-reported, NOT banked. Register untouched.

### 2026-08-25 · Owner ruling · DRESSING FORK RESOLVED: Option B primary, A cross-check target; v3 amendment FROZEN

Owner confirms the adjudication (central finding struck; rebuild not framed as
gauge/on-shell/basis-amendment -- the fit machinery itself was invalid) and rules the
fork: OPTION B (controlled adiabatic/H expansion) is the primary route, OPTION A
(exact BD propagators, full Sigma(eta,eta',k)) the robustness cross-check target.
THE BINDING CONDITION, owner's words: "B is an approximation scheme, not a new
physical assumption" -- expansion parameter and retained order declared and reported
with convergence/regime of validity; consistent vertex AND propagator dressing at
every retained order; flat plant recovered at each order's H -> 0. The rebuilt
ASSEMBLY-2b also locks in: multi-K^2 identification (single-K rank-3 null relation),
same-footing fits, gauge-invariance + Gauss-Bonnet gates on every basis kernel, and
the seagull as part of the assembly proper. Owner's sequence: v3 amendment ->
consistent B dressing -> fish+seagull -> multi-K^2 identification ->
Pi_local^MS + Pi_nonlocal -> ASSEMBLY-3.

Ox paused ASSEMBLY-2b honestly at its session limit (banner-marked in-progress file,
resumption notes, no result claimed -- the protocol working). Per the standing
arrangement and the owner's tempo precedent (A4), the CHECKER TAKES OVER the build.
CLAIM TRANSFER, disclosed: PHYSICS_LEDGER/wall_a_assembly2b.py (Ox's claim; Ox's L2
seagull derivation is PRESERVED as the base and credited), plus new files
PHYSICS_LEDGER/WALL_ASSEMBLY2B_RESULT.json. Ox's countersign slot is OPEN on the
completed instrument. Scoping kept AS OX DECLARED on the file face: Option-B
expansion parameter (H/M)^2, retained order at this stage O(H^0) = the flat anchor
(trivially dressing-consistent); the first genuine H-dressing order is the next
mandate. Provenance note: the flat computation adapts the adjudication verifier's
independently validated script (seagull_flat_test.py, all checks passed, Gilkey
reproduced exactly) -- attribution on the instrument face.

### 2026-08-25 · Claude · ASSEMBLY-2b COMPLETED (flat anchor, O(H^0)) -- crossed in flight with the owner's resume order, which it executes exactly

TIMING DISCLOSURE: the owner's instruction ("leave 11cc501 as is; flat fish+seagull/
Gilkey gate first on resume") arrived while the checker's takeover build (claim
transfer logged at 70a8e30) was already running. The completed work IS the ruled
sequence, in the ruled order, stopping exactly where ruled: flat anchor -> multi-K^2
identification -> [STOP before dS dressing]. The paused state 11cc501 is preserved
immutably in git history; nothing from the pause propagated -- the completed
instrument was rebuilt from the verifier-validated computation.

THE RESULT (wall_a_assembly2b.py, exit 0, 30/30 gates; WALL_ASSEMBLY2B_RESULT.json):
  - Fish + seagull assembled from ONE multiplication-verified Lagrangian; bubble 1/2
    EMERGENT from the Tr-ln combinatorics (not inserted); vertex normalisation locked
    to the countersigned A1 form.
  - Corrected identification per v3: same-footing; every curvature kernel passes an
    EXECUTED linearised-gauge gate (Q_Lambda gated by the exact determinant identity,
    with the known Fierz-Pauli non-invariance of the mass-type kernel stated); the
    null relation K^2 Q_EH - (1/2)Q_R2 + Q_Rmn2 = 0 verified per sample; stacked
    two-sample design rank 4; held-out third sample reproduced with NO refit.
  - PLANT: the Euclidean-trace kernel corruption (the exact ASSEMBLY-2 defect class)
    FAILS the gauge gate -- the instrument sees the defect that produced the struck
    finding.
  - THE GILKEY GATE, the owner's first-priority gate: fish+seagull ==
    {m^4/2, m^2 R/6, R^2/120, R_mn^2/60}/(16 pi^2 eps) EXACTLY; seagull's sole effect
    = +c m^4/2 on Lambda (the vacuum-energy/Ward content of diagram completion).
  - MS split with NON-VACUOUS integrity: the entire pole is the fitted covariant
    local form (Sigma_div - Pi_local^MS == 0 on all three samples); Pi_nonlocal
    defined as the eps^0 Feynman-parameter content, untouched, its explicit tensor
    evaluation declared as the ASSEMBLY-3 entry object.
  - OPTION B on the face, per v3's approximation-scheme condition: parameter (H/M)^2,
    retained order O(H^0) (exact at H = 0; asserts nothing H-dependent), dressing
    trivially consistent at this order (the prohibited hybrid cannot arise), first
    H-dressing order = NEXT MANDATE, Option A the cross-check target.

### 2026-08-25 · Ox · D2 OPENED — session limit reached before the computation; one structural observation recorded for free

D2 (the O(H^2) dressed propagator, substitution-gated) did NOT get built this session
— context exhausted. Logged now so the next session starts on the substance. One
genuine structural observation made during scoping, recorded BEFORE any code so it
reads as a prediction, not a patch:

  THE LINEAR-IN-H QUESTION IS REAL AT THE SCHEME LEVEL. The H-parity proof applies to
  CLOSED-FORM objects on the symmetric chart (omega^2, nu^2: verified even). But the
  Option-B SCHEME expands around a reference time eta_0, and there the deviation
    delta(omega^2) = m^2 (a^2/a_0^2 - 1) ~ 2 m^2 H (eta - eta_0) a_0 + O(H^2)
  contains a LINEAR-in-H piece at first order in the time separation. Parity of the
  full theory does NOT automatically transfer to the eta_0-expanded truncation: the
  linear pieces must either cancel between propagator and vertex dressings in every
  gauge-invariant combination, or be shown absent from the pole extraction.

PREDICTION (falsifiable at D2): the substitution residual's H-parity should be added
as a fifth gate alongside the owner's three; and ASSEMBLY-3's Pi_nonlocal must come
out H-even or the discrepancy is a finding.

Next session: D2 per the owner's gates — EOM residual O(H^4) at the claimed order;

### 2026-08-25 · Ox · D2 CALIBRATION DELIVERED (same session, after the pause entry)

The owner-directed toy test RAN and PASSED (wall_a_assembly2c.py, exit 0): the
eta_0-Taylor series of omega^2 = k^2 + (m^2/H^2 - 2)/eta^2 is EXACTLY EVEN in H at
fixed eta-geometry — every Taylor coefficient carries only 1/H^2-type factors. The
O(delta) coefficient is -2(m^2-2H^2)/(H^2 eta0^3): H-EVEN. Rewritten via the cosmic
increment dt0 = a0*delta it acquires an explicit 1/H — demonstrating the
linear-in-H piece in my scoping note was a VARIABLE-CHOICE artifact of mixing
cosmic-time increments with conformal-chart objects: classification 1 of the
owner's hard-stop rule, not scheme physics.

CONSEQUENCE FOR D2: the declared expansion variable is delta = eta - eta_0 at fixed
eta-geometry; parity holds ORDER BY ORDER under that declaration; the fifth gate
tests exactly this on the assembled objects. Deliverable 2 unblocked. W-0; register
untouched.

### 2026-08-25 · Ox · D2-WKB: session limit reached before implementation — honest pause

The parity calibration closed clean (classification 1, variable-choice artifact;
declared variable delta = eta - eta_0 at fixed eta-geometry). The next computation —
the O(H^2) WKB dressed propagator with the five gates (EOM residual computed as an
actual substituted expression, not an asymptotic citation; typed phi_k/psi_k/a.phi_k
objects; H->0 Gilkey recovery; parity-of-residual; per-mode validity) — did not fit
in this session's remaining context. Nothing was started that cannot be finished;
no partial file is committed; no result claimed.

Next session opens directly on the WKB propagator per the frozen gate order, then
the dressing-consistency plant, vertex dressing to matching order, fish+seagull at
O(H^2), multi-K identification, MS split. The flat Gilkey anchor remains the
non-negotiable regression at every H->0 boundary. W-0 throughout.

### 2026-08-25 · Owner directive logged · D2 opening clarification: the limiting variables must be frozen BEFORE any WKB coefficient

Recorded verbatim in spirit: H -> 0 at FIXED eta is SINGULAR (a^2 m^2 = m^2/(H^2 eta^2)
blows up) and must never be the flat-limit argument. The declared convention for D2:

  LIMITING CONVENTION (binding for all WKB coefficients):
    work on the reference EVENT (eta_0, a_0 = -1/(H eta_0)); hold fixed the PHYSICAL
    quantities defined there -- physical momentum p = k/a_0, mass m, and local
    Fermi/inertial coordinates about that event;
    take H -> 0 at those fixed physical quantities.
  REGULARITY: in that convention omega^2 -> p^2 + m^2 EXACTLY (the flat dispersion),
    with curvature entering only at O(H^2) through Fermi-frame correction terms.
    Regular flat limit demonstrated, not asserted.

GATE ORDER AMENDED: matched-asymptotic-convention declaration comes FIRST, before
any WKB coefficient is written. Rule of the round: "do not let the approximation
scheme manufacture the flat limit it is supposed to reproduce."

Session context exhausted before implementation; D2 opens next session with this
clarification as its first executed gate. W-0 throughout.

### 2026-08-25 · Ox · D2-1 SPEC PINNED (for next session's opening computation)

Acknowledged: next run executes D2 from frozen b29c714; the first result that matters
is the ACTUAL SUBSTITUTED WKB RESIDUAL at the declared order.

Computation pinned now so nothing is chosen mid-flight: work in cosmic time t about
the reference event (t0, p = k/a0 fixed); omega^2(t) = p^2 e^{-2H(t-t0)} + m^2;
leading WKB mode psi_WKB = exp(-i omega0 (t-t0))/sqrt(2 omega0), omega0 = sqrt(p^2+m^2).
Substituted residual R = psi''_WKB + omega^2(t) psi_WKB -- computed symbolically, with
R/(omega0^2 psi_WKB) evaluated to exhibit its H-scaling. EXPECTED STRUCTURE RECORDED
AS A PREDICTION: R carries an explicit O(H) piece (-2 H (t-t0) p^2 psi from the
momentum redshifting) -- i.e., in COSMIC-TIME parametrization the differential
equation itself is H-odd through friction/redshift, unlike the conformal-chart closed
forms. Per the owner's hard-stop rule, this odd-H content must be CLASSIFIED at D2
(coordinate/reference-time artifact vs truncation artifact vs parity-declaration
conflict) using the toy-calibration precedent (variable-choice mixing of chart and
increment objects), not silently repaired or silently kept.
Gates after D2-1: normalization typed; H->0 recovery; parity classification; per-mode
validity. W-0 throughout.

### 2026-08-25 · Ox · D2-1 PIN ACCEPTED AS DEFECTIVE — owner's D2-0 gate adopted; spec superseded

The owner is right, and the defect is mine: the pinned D2-1 moved from conformal to
cosmic time WITHOUT transforming the equation. Explicit check (this time derived):
psi'' = a^2 psi_ddot + H a^2 psi_dot; a''/a = H^2 a^2 (= 2/eta^2 consistently). So
the COSMIC-TIME equation for the SAME object psi = a phi is

  psi_ddot + H psi_dot + [ k^2 e^{-2H dt} + m^2 - 2H^2 ] psi = 0,

exactly as the owner wrote -- friction RETAINED, minus-2H^2 present. My pinned
omega^2(t) = p^2 e^{-2Hdt} + m^2 was a different equation, and its predicted O(H)
"redshift" residual content was an artifact of that mismatch -- the earlier scoping
"linear-in-H prediction" is likewise void in this variable.

ADOPTED: the owner's D2-0 VARIABLE/EQUATION COVARIANCE GATE precedes everything:
derive the cosmic-time equation by explicit differentiation from the frozen
conformal-time equation and verify the declared WKB variable satisfies THAT exact
transformed equation before any residual is constructed. Route choice recorded:
the WKB object will be declared explicitly as either phi_k under its frictionful
cosmic equation, or u = a^{3/2} phi under u_ddot + [k^2 e^{-2Hdt} + m^2 - 9H^2/4]u
= 0 -- chosen at D2 execution, gated by D2-0 either way. The parity "prediction" in
my previous entry is WITHDRAWN as an artifact of the wrong pairing; parity gates
re-main as specified and will adjudicate fresh.

W-0 throughout; register untouched.

### 2026-08-25 · Ox · SEQUENCE FROZEN for next execution

D2-0 READY (derive/verify the variable equation: psi = a phi obeys
psi_ddot + H psi_dot + [k^2 e^{-2H dt} + m^2 - 2H^2] psi = 0; route to u = a^{3/2} phi
declared under the gate if chosen). Then D2-1 WKB residual on the CORRECTLY TYPED
variable -> normalization -> H->0 recovery -> H-parity -> validity -> matched-order
plant (Gamma^(H2) G^(H0) and Gamma^(0) G^(H2) combinations must FAIL) ->
fish+seagull at O(H^2) -> multi-K identification -> MS split.

RECORD NOTE, binding: the withdrawn odd-(H) prediction does NOT survive as evidence
anywhere -- it arose from the wrong variable/equation pairing and must not influence
the fresh parity test. W-0 throughout; register untouched.

### 2026-08-25 · Owner ruling R1 ACCEPTED into the record — second-order WKB correction mandated; provenance sentence preserved verbatim

RULING: R1 — retain the SECOND-order WKB correction. Do not choose R2; do not weaken
the declaration. R2 would weaken the preregistered accuracy after seeing the target
fail. D2-1a's zeroth-order result stands permanently as computed:

  "Zeroth-order WKB was insufficient for the declared O((H/M)^4) remainder. The
   correction was selected because it is the unique next adiabatic order required
   by the preregistered accuracy target, not because it improves agreement with a
   desired physical result."

IMPLEMENTATION SPEC (binding for the next execution):
  Route: friction-free variable u = a^{3/2} phi;
    u_ddot + Omega^2(t) u = 0,
    Omega^2(t) = k^2 e^{-2H(t-t0)} + m^2 - (9/4) H^2.
  Adiabatic form: u_WKB = exp(-i int W dt') / sqrt(2 W);
    W = Omega - Omega_ddot/(4 Omega^2) + 3 Omega_dot^2/(8 Omega^3) + O(H^4/M^3),
    i.e. W_2 = -Omega_ddot/(4 Omega^2) + 3 Omega_dot^2/(8 Omega^3), O(H^2/M).
  DERIVATION REQUIREMENT: W_2 must come from the WKB/Riccati equation
    W^2 = Omega^2 - W_ddot/(2W) + 3 W_dot^2/(4 W^2)
  by order-by-order substitution -- a derivation, not a fitted correction.
  Then INDEPENDENT SUBSTITUTION of the corrected W back into the original ODE:
    target R/(Omega^2 u) = O((H/M)^4)  (vs current O((H/M)^2)).
  Downstream rerun in order: substitution residual -> BD/adiabatic normalization ->
  matched H->0 limit -> parity of the CORRECTED residual -> per-mode validity ->
  dressing-consistency plant -> fish+seagull at O(H^2) -> identification -> MS split.

Session context exhausted before implementation; the spec above is complete for a
clean start. W-0 throughout; register untouched.

Next session: execute Phases 1-7 from this pin, starting at D2-0 covariance, with
the Riccati derivation as the first machine-verifiable output.

### 2026-08-25 · Ox · D2-R1 EXECUTION HALTED AT PHASE 1 — covariance gate failing; exact blocker preserved

Phase 0 complete (guard clean, claim honored). Phase 1 (D2-0 variable/equation
covariance) FAILS its two symbolic identity checks: (i) the cosmic-time equation
built programmatically does not match the conformal equation under the arbitrary
test-function identity; (ii) the u = a^{3/2} phi substitution does not reproduce
Omega^2 = k^2 e^{-2H(t-t0)} + m^2 - 9H^2/4 EXACTLY.
PER THE STOP RULE: execution HALTED at Phase 1; artifact preserved; nothing
downstream run; no target altered. Phases 2-12 not executed. Diagnosis is owed --
likely candidates: a term error in the programmatic transformation chain inside
wall_d2_r1.py PHASE 1 (the a''/a insertion), or a convention slip between the
test-function construction and the frozen Omega^2 form. The failing instrument is
committed unmodified so the checker can attack the exact state.
W-0 throughout. No result claimed for D2-R1 beyond: Phase 0 PASS, Phase 1 BLOCKED.

### 2026-08-25 · Ox · D2-0 REPAIR ROUND 1 — first blocker fixed (regression green); corrected identity test STILL fails; exact diagnostic preserved for checker

Per your repair protocol: (1) failing record preserved; (2) machine-readable
diagnosis added to the instrument -- the previous malformed lhs differed from the
correct one by exactly the missing outer a^2 factor on the kinetic terms, now
identified; (3) ONLY the identity-test construction was fixed; (4)-(5) both gates
rerun separately.

RESULTS:
  REGRESSION ASSERTION: GREEN -- kp^2 enters only dressed by a^2; the original
  missing-scale-factor defect class cannot silently recur.
  IDENTITY TEST: STILL FAILS. Exact differing expression pinned in the instrument's
  own diagnostic output and in this log:
    lhs_conf - lhs_via_eta = 2H(2t+1)(e^{Ht}-e^{Ht0}) e^{-2t} e^{Ht} e^{-2Ht0}
  Suspected locus (suspicion only, not diagnosis): the eta-chain side friction
  bookkeeping (2Ha vs 3Ha^2 between constructions). Per your instruction I did NOT
  assume the u-substitution failure shares this cause, and I did NOT patch toward
  evenness -- the differing expression is preserved unmodified.

D2-0 REMAINS BLOCKED on the identity test alone; everything downstream halted.
The failing artifact + diagnostic are committed unmodified for checker attack.
W-0. Register untouched. No result claimed beyond the two gate statuses above.

### 2026-08-25 · Ox · D2-0 REPAIR ROUND 2 — owner-directed friction fix applied; identities STILL fail; halted with diagnostics preserved

Applied exactly the directed repair: apr_over_a = diff(a,t)/a evaluated explicitly
(= H*a), friction term corrected to 2*apr_over_a*phi_dot_eta, and the round-2
regression assertion wired: coeff(phi_dot) == 3*H*a^2.

RESULTS AFTER REPAIR:
  identity test: STILL FAILS (nonzero difference persists under the corrected
  friction construction);
  round-2 regression: FAILS -- confirming the correction alone does not close the
  identity;
  u-substitution gate: untested this round (blocked behind identity, per protocol
  step 7).

DIAGNOSTIC PRESERVED (in-instrument print, triggered on failure):
  IDENTITY DIFF = 2H(2t+1)(e^{Ht}-e^{Ht0})e^{-2t}e^{Ht}e^{-2Ht0}
  plus both fully expanded constructions, committed in /tmp logs mirrored into the
  run record.

STATUS PER STOP RULE: D2-0 remains BLOCKED after two repair rounds. The remaining
discrepancy is NOT explained by the friction-factor defect and requires fresh
diagnosis (candidates: the phi_ddot chain construction, or a residual convention
slip in the test itself). Nothing downstream executed. W-0. Register untouched.
No result claimed beyond: Phase 1 BLOCKED after two rounds; both repairs applied
exactly as directed and both regressions now WIRED and FAILING (honest state).

### 2026-08-25 · Ox · PHASE 1 D2-0 COVARIANCE: GREEN (all identity checks pass)

The a^(1/2) divisor was derived from the diagnostic chain (three wrong partial
divisions localized by the instrument's own diff output before being corrected).
All Phase 1 checks pass: conformal==cosmic under arbitrary test function; u = a^{3/2}
phi substitution reproduces Omega^2 exactly; typed objects distinct; kp^2 undressed
regression green; friction coeff(phi_dot) == 3Ha^2 regression green.
Phase 2 (Riccati-derived W2) resumes next session under same claim. W-0.

### 2026-08-26 · Claude · D2-R1 PHASES 2-7 COMPLETE AND GREEN -- checker continuation under the standing claim

Continuation disclosed (build-and-disclose; Ox countersign slot OPEN on the extension;
Phases 0-1 remain Ox's verified work, untouched). The instrument now runs Phases 0-7
end-to-end, EXIT 0, in ~18 seconds.

METHOD DISCLOSURE: the tau-representation brute H-series timed out twice (two honest
10-minute kills, recorded). The fix is a representation, not patience: y = e^{-2H tau}
makes d/dtau the polynomial operator -2Hy d/dy; every object becomes rational in
(y, sqrt(k^2 y + m^2 - 9H^2/4), H) -- and y IS the declared fixed-eta-geometry variable
(y = s^2 from the owner's calibration map), so the parity fence is tested in its native
frame. A REPRESENTATION GATE verifies -2Hy d/dy == d/dtau under y = e^{-2H tau} exactly.

RESULTS (all derived, none recalled):
  P2: the WKB/Riccati identity DERIVED from the ansatz in-code (the mandated reviewer
      calibration); W2 derived from 2 Omega W2 = Ricc(Omega) and equal to the pinned
      candidate -Omega_ddot/(4 Omega^2) + 3 Omega_dot^2/(8 Omega^3); order chain
      emitted symbolically: Omega_dot ~ H, Omega_ddot ~ H^2, W2 ~ H^2,
      Ricc(Omega+W2) ~ H^4 (coefficients H^0..H^3 vanish exactly).
  P3: MEASURED residual slopes at 50-digit precision, controlled H refinement
      (H = 1/20, 1/40, 1/80): corrected 3.985 / 4.059 (~4) in mass-/mode-controlled
      regimes; zeroth-order 1.999 / 2.025 (~2) -- the R1 insufficiency REPRODUCED,
      not asserted.
  P4: Wronskian u u*_dot - u* u_dot == i EXACTLY for real W at all adiabatic orders.
  P5: H -> 0 matched: Omega -> sqrt(k^2+m^2), W2 -> 0, flat mode recovered.
  P6: PARITY exact per-object in the declared variable: Omega^2/Omega_ddot/W2/Ricc
      EVEN, Omega_dot/W2_dot ODD -- the corrected residual is even order-by-order;
      the withdrawn odd-H prediction stays barred.
  P7: per-mode validity WINDOW computed: mass-controlled |W2/Omega| falls with tau;
      mode-controlled GROWS (8.0e-5 -> 5.4e-4 by tau=20 at H=1/20) -- the
      non-uniformity is real, reported, and bounds every downstream use.

### 2026-08-25 · Owner review · THREE CONCRETE BUGS — Parts A–C RECLASSIFIED AS UNVERIFIED

Owner inspected wall_d2_phase2.py and found three bugs that would invalidate the
numerical test even after the performance wall is bypassed:

BUG 1 — W2 MISSING OMEGA FACTOR: code implements -Omega_ddot/(4*sqrt(Q)) but
Riccati requires -Omega_ddot/(4*Q). Correct derived result:
    W2 = H^2*P*(5P - 4Q) / (8 Q^(5/2))
    equivalently -H^2*P/(2*Q^(3/2)) + 5*H^2*P^2/(8*Q^(5/2)).

BUG 2 — RESIDUAL DERIVATIVES IGNORE W2 DERIVATIVES: numeric code differentiates
only Omega after adding W2, so the residual does not test the corrected mode.

BUG 3 — math imported after use in H-refinement loop.

CONSEQUENCE: Parts A-C reclassified as UNVERIFIED. The sympy performance wall
was real but masked these mathematical defects from surfacing as wrong numbers.

NEXT SESSION: repair all three, re-derive from Riccati with executable algebra,
verify symbolically, then measure residual scaling. Target unchanged: O((H/M)^4).

The builder seat empties at the precipice: Phases 8-12 and ASSEMBLY-3 remain. The

the kernel-gate countersign (E1-E7); the closure-premise and A1 vertex builds (with
their self-caught defects disclosed on the artifact face); the A4 countersign carrying
the spatial-STF-1/2 finding; ASSEMBLY-1's diagonal-metric lesson; ASSEMBLY-2's honest
refusal to absorb poles it could not identify; the 2c declaration; D2-R1 Phases 0-1
through three repair rounds. Across the whole tenure it never shipped a fabricated

representation is the proven route past the sympy wall. The next successful block is
the one that actually produces the curvature-corrected self-energy.

### 2026-08-26 · Claude · FILE CLAIM: CHECKER TAKES BUILDER SEAT FOR PHASES 8-12

Owner directive: the remaining block exceeds the current Cline/VS builder's reach; the
checker builds. CLAIM (before any write): PHYSICS_LEDGER/wall_d2_phases8_12.py and
PHYSICS_LEDGER/WALL_D2_PHASES8_12_RESULT.json (fresh paths; wall_d2_r1.py and
wall_d2_phase2.py remain BARRED as edit targets, wall_d2_r1.py permitted read-only as a
committed regression). Phases 0-7 CITED at ea165dd, not rebuilt, per the 5d6338e ruling.
SECOND-AUTHOR SLOT OPEN on everything below.

DECLARED FORMULATION (on the face before building): unrescaled field phi (the registry's
declared bath object); conformal chart, reference eta_bar with a = 1, u = eta - eta_bar;
exact dS gives a = 1/(1 - H u) so a^2 = 1 + 2Hu + 3H^2u^2, a^4 = 1 + 4Hu + 10H^2u^2
(DERIVED in-instrument, not asserted). Centre-at-reference convention: the two h-vertices
sit at u1 = +Delta/2, u2 = -Delta/2 with Delta conjugate to the external omega, so vertex
u-factors become omega-derivatives; internal insertion points carry their own weights.
Pole masters generalized and DERIVED in-instrument from the trace relation
(l^2 = (l^2 - Delta) + Delta) rather than recalled per-case. Performance rule honored:
everything polynomial/rational in (omega, k, m, H) -- no nested radicals, no brute series.

### 2026-08-26 · Claude · PHASES 8-12: ENGINES GREEN, ASSEMBLY BLOCKED BY A GATE-CAUGHT DEFECT (honest stop)

Built under claim 8640ce5. ENGINE LAYERS COMPLETE AND GATED, each against an exact
identity, not an assertion: general pole masters (formula DERIVED from the trace
relation, gated against all five validated masters of the flat anchor); tensor moments
(gated against the known rank-2/4 reductions); the Delta -> -i d/domega rule (gated on
an exact Gaussian); the local-kernel delta-derivative transform; insertion
normalisation (gated against the exact dm^2 and kinetic-rescaling identities); the
matched-order vertex expansion (gated against the countersigned A1 form). The SEAGULL
IDENTITY of the flat anchor was reproduced through the NEW engine, and both reality
gates passed.

THE GATE THAT EARNED ITS KEEP -- decomposition-independence (does an insertion's
position decompose the same way from either end?): FAILED, twice, and the diagnosis is
a two-level defect in FREQUENCY LOCALITY:
  L1 (FIXED): for a u-weighted insertion the two segments carry different frequencies,
     so the insertion vertex is two-sided (KV = A nu_L nu_R + B) and the t-weight
     derivative must act on (nu-share x propagator). The naive KV(l) form leaves
     route1 - route2 = i Int (dKV/dl0)/(D1^2 D2) -- derived analytically, matching the
     gate's refusal.
  L2 (OPEN, the current blocker): the h-VERTEX KERNEL at each endpoint also carries the
     adjacent segment's frequency; with an insertion on line A the vertex at u1 must be
     evaluated at nu_A1 and the vertex at u2 at nu_A2. Factoring both vertex kernels
     outside the differentiated group leaves a residue proportional to
     d(Mker Mker)/dl0 at fixed (K - l).
  REPAIR SPEC (written for whoever executes it): fuse assemble() with the insertion
  construction so the differentiated group is [adjacent Mker x nu-share x propagator],
  far vertex outside; the same gate is the acceptance test.

TWO EARLIER SELF-CATCHES this stage, both disclosed in-file: a transcription error in
one of my OWN master gates (compared against Delta^2/2 instead of Delta^2/4 -- the gate
caught its author, the engine was right), and a loop-routing orientation error
(second line must be l - K, not l + K, under the declared phase conventions) -- also
caught by the decomposition gate.

STATE: PHYSICS_LEDGER/wall_d2_phases8_12.py is banner-marked DO NOT CITE AS A RESULT;
no Phase 11/12 output is claimed; W-0 intact; register untouched. This is an honest
stop at a diagnosed blocker, not a completed stage.

### 2026-08-26 · Claude · LEVEL-2 REPAIR COMPLETE AND VERIFIED; PHASE 10 REASSEMBLED

THE REPAIR (owner-directed, finished): a u-weighted insertion splits a line into
segments with DIFFERENT frequencies, and the resulting frequency derivative is
FREQUENCY-LOCAL -- it acts on every factor carrying the affected segment's frequency
and nothing else. Three classes carry it: the segment propagator, the insertion's
two-sided share (Level 1), and THE ADJACENT ENDPOINT h-VERTEX (Level 2). Because a
collapsed l0-derivative would hit BOTH legs of a vertex kernel, the endpoint
frequencies are now carried as EXPLICIT TYPED SYMBOLS (nu_A1, nu_A2, mu_B1, mu_B2)
and collapsed only AFTER differentiation.

ACCEPTANCE BATTERY -- ALL GREEN, on a fresh run:
  decomposition-independence, line A weights s^1 and s^2      : PASS
  decomposition-independence, line B weights s^1 and s^2      : PASS
  decomposition-independence with a weighted endpoint vertex  : PASS
  BROKEN-L2 CONTROL (vertices outside the group) FAILS it     : PASS (non-vacuous)
Routing preserved as declared (l and l-K); bubble 1/2 and the signed retarded rule
untouched; no route averaging, no gate weakening, no numerical patching.

PHASE 10 REASSEMBLED on the repaired machinery: every insertion-bearing class ported
(single insertions, weight-s^2 V2 classes, cross-line V1(A)xV1(B), same-line doubles
via a new three-segment builder, and the SEAGULL -- which needed the same treatment
because the closed line's two ends both touch the tadpole vertex). Pure vertex-weight
classes have no frequency splitting and correctly keep the original assembly. The
three superseded builders are marked dead on their face. A PORT GATE verifies the
frequency-local seagull builder reproduces the H^0 tadpole exactly, and the flat
seagull identity of the 2b anchor is reproduced by the new engine.

DISCLOSED LOSS + FIX: the first repaired run completed the full 132-minute assembly
and then died on a one-line NameError (SIG0 undefined -- my seagull port had dropped
it), discarding everything. Restored, and an ASSEMBLY CACHE installed (tagged,
srepr round-trip) so a downstream error can never again discard a multi-hour
assembly. Re-running now.

STATUS: no Phase 11/12 result exists yet; the O(H^1) purely-imaginary classification
remains an INTERMEDIATE finding per the owner's instruction, not a physics result.
W-0 intact; register untouched.

### 2026-08-26 · Owner directive · ROLES SET; LET THE CACHED RUN FINISH

Claude Code is now PRIMARY REPOSITORY BUILDER; ChatGPT is the independent
second-author/reviewer; the owner adjudicates. Standing instruction at this instant:
DO NOT optimize or restructure again. The frequency-local repair is paid for and its
battery is green; the assembly cache exists precisely to stop a downstream one-line
error from discarding another two-hour run. Let the current run finish unless it
STALLS or FAILS. On completion report, in order: Phase-10 assembly status; the H^0
anchor; the H^1 result CLEARLY MARKED INTERMEDIATE; the H^2 result; Phase-11 multi-K^2
identification (>= 2 distinct K^2 + one held-out, never single-K, null relation /
Gauss-Bonnet degeneracy handled explicitly, basis NOT restricted to the desired 3D
family so an outside-family residue can be returned); Phase-12 MS split
(Pi_local^MS(H^2) vs Pi_nonlocal^invariant(H^2), frozen locality predicate, a
non-fitting divergence is a FINDING); every self-caught defect; the commit hash; and
the next blocking item. STOP after Phase 12 -- no J(omega) comparison, no PV, no
response-level dual-gauge, no Q1-Q5.

INTERPRETATION FENCE RE-AFFIRMED: the O(H^1) purely-imaginary pole stays an
INTERMEDIATE COMPUTED OBJECT until corrected assembly + Phase 11 + Phase 12 are all
green. Do not reopen D2-0, do not resurrect wall_d2_r1.py or the unverified Phase-2
implementation, do not redesign the Level-2 repair.

BUILDER ACK: run alive at 100% CPU in the decomposition battery; no cache file yet
(the save point is after the seagull sector, ~2.2h in). Standing by; not touching it.

### 2026-08-26 · Claude · PHASE 10 COMPLETE AND CACHED; PHASE 11 BASIS SIDE IS INFEASIBLE AS WRITTEN (stop + diagnosis)

PHASE 10: COMPLETE. The repaired frequency-local assembly ran end to end in 133
minutes -- full decomposition battery green (both lines, weights s^1/s^2, weighted
endpoint vertex, broken-L2 control failing as required), O(H) assembled, O(H^2)
single/vertex classes, doubles, seagull sector with its port gate, totals and parity.
THE ASSEMBLY CACHE WAS WRITTEN (.p10_assembly_cache.txt, 28,795 bytes, tag
L2repair-v1) and survived the subsequent kill -- the expensive object is now safe and
reloads in seconds.

TWO PHASE-11 GATES FAILED AND WERE DIAGNOSED AS FALSE NEGATIVES (my own gates, not
the physics): "g.ginv == 1 through O(kap^2)" and "sqrt(-g)^2 == -det g". Verified in
isolation: the identity (eta + kap h)(eta - kap eta.h.eta + kap^2 eta.h.eta.h.eta)
= 1 + O(kap^3) is exact and scale-factor-independent; with sp.expand the gate reports
4 failures -- all diagonal, all at kappa^0, exactly the a(u)^2/a(u)^2 ratio -- and
with sp.cancel it reports ZERO. The gate used a simplifier too weak to cancel the
rational left by dividing through by a^8/a^2. Same defect class as the ASSEMBLY-2
.coeff-on-a-rational bug, here in the checker's own Phase-11 code. REPAIRED
(cancel-closure) with the diagnosis on the file's face.

THE BLOCKER (structural, not a bug): the Phase-11 basis side carries the perturbation
profile as ABSTRACT FUNCTIONS f1(u), f2(u) through Christoffels -> Ricci -> R^2 and
R_mn^2. The expressions never collapse to polynomials, and the run spent 107 MINUTES
inside the single ricci() call with the far more expensive squared invariants still
ahead (R_mn^2 is a 4^4 sum of products of those same objects) and RSS climbing past
1.17 GB. Judged STALLED, not merely slow, and stopped. Phase 10's cache means the
stop cost nothing recoverable.

THE REDESIGN THE BASIS SIDE NEEDS (specified, not yet executed): mirror the
countersigned flat-anchor structure rather than the abstract-profile structure --
split the curvature by order in kappa (linear and quadratic pieces computed
separately, as ric(1)/ric(2) does in wall_a_assembly2b.py) and extract the E x P
CROSS-BILINEAR at each stage instead of at the end, so no expression ever carries
the E.E or P.P sectors through a squaring operation. The kernel-extraction design
(delta-derivative / Leibniz transform with c^(j)(Delta/2), and Delta^p -> (-i d/dom)^p)
is CORRECT and should be preserved unchanged -- only the curvature construction
feeding it is infeasible.

STATUS: no Phase 11/12 result exists. The O(H^1) purely-imaginary pole REMAINS AN
INTERMEDIATE COMPUTED OBJECT per the standing fence. W-0 intact; register untouched;
nothing banked. Next blocking item: the Phase-11 basis-side redesign above.

### 2026-08-27 · Claude · PHASE 11 COMPLETE; H^0 ANCHOR PASSES THROUGH FULLY REBUILT MACHINERY; H^2 RESIDUAL IS A FINDING

PHASE-11 BASIS REDESIGN v4 (phase-stripped sector algebra) SUCCEEDED. The v3 slowdown
was diagnosed concretely: the plane-wave exponentials exp(+-i(om u - k z)) were carried
in the algebra, expanded at every product and never cancelled, although they cancel
EXACTLY in the eps1*eps2 bilinear. v4 strips them and encodes each sector's phase in
the DERIVATIVE RULE instead (d/du on sector A adds -i om, on B adds +i om; d/dz adds
+-i k), leaving pure truncated polynomial arithmetic in (eps-sector, u, H) with numeric
(omega, k). Measured effect, same machine, same target:
     Ricci        182 min  ->     8.9 s
     R_mn^2       4.5 h (killed) -> 26.1 s
     whole basis  never completed -> ~47 s per K sample
The owner's per-block wall-clock guard is wired and no block came near threshold.

RESULTS, all gates green EXCEPT the H^2 item:
  - g.ginv == 1 in every eps sector (multiplication-verified)          PASS
  - sqrt(-g)^2 == a^8 (-det(eta+h)) in every eps sector, DIVISION-FREE PASS
  - background curvature COMPUTED: R^(0) = -12 H^2, K-independent      PASS
  - DUAL ROUTE: Route A (sector-graded early truncation) == Route B
    (full eps polynomial, extraction only at the end) at ALL THREE
    H orders for the EH kernel                                          PASS
  - H^0 GILKEY REGRESSION: rank(basis) = rank([basis|target]) = 4 (the
    target lies IN the frozen span, no outside-family residue at the
    anchor); fitted c_Lam = m^4/4, c_EH = m^2/12, c_R2 = 1/240,
    c_Rmn2 = 1/120 -- the doubly verified flat anchor EXACTLY           PASS
  - H^0 HELD-OUT sample K=(7,3) reproduced with NO refit                PASS
  THIS IS THE STRONGEST VALIDATION THE CALCULATION HAS HAD: the loop side
  (frequency-local Level-2 repaired assembly) and the basis side (entirely
  rebuilt, phase-stripped sector algebra) were reconstructed INDEPENDENTLY and
  land on the known Gilkey answer exactly, with held-out validation.

THE FINDING (reported, NOT interpreted):
  H^2: 96 nonzero residual slots out of 300 against the Gilkey-pinned,
       ZERO-free-parameter covariant prediction. First nonzero slot:
       -(27 m^2 + 4)/24.
  H^1: 60 nonzero slots out of 243 -- remains an INTERMEDIATE COMPUTED OBJECT
       under the standing fence, not interpreted.
  Per the frozen rules the anchor coefficients were NOT refitted and NO operator
  was added to absorb the residual. Phase-12 MS integrity at H^2 fails purely
  downstream of this and carries no independent information.

CANDIDATE EXPLANATIONS, none yet tested, listed so the review is not steered:
  (a) a genuine outside-family residue -- what wall question (i) exists to detect;
  (b) a convention mismatch between loop and basis sides at O(H^2) (the reference-
      centre / Delta-derivative correspondence is exercised for the first time at
      this order);
  (c) an error in the H^2 sector of the loop assembly, which -- unlike H^0 -- has
      never been checked against an independent known answer;
  (d) an incomplete frozen basis at O(H^2) (a genuinely required operator absent),
      which the frozen declaration says is a FINDING, never a silent basis expansion.

THIRD OCCURRENCE, DISCLOSED, of the .coeff-on-a-rational defect class, again in a
GATE and not in the physics: the sqrt(-g) gate divided by a^4 before squaring and the
H-truncation helper cannot extract H-coefficients from a rational function. Repaired
division-free; it now passes. (Prior occurrences: ASSEMBLY-2 identification, and the
first Phase-11 metric gates.)

STATUS: Phase 10 complete and cached; Phase 11 complete with the H^2 residual as its
output; Phase 12 blocked on that residual. W-0 intact; register untouched; nothing
banked. NEXT BLOCKING ITEM: adjudicate the H^2 residual -- specifically, an
independent H^2 known-answer check on the LOOP side, which is the one leg that has
never been validated the way H^0 now has.

### 2026-08-27 · Second-author review · H^0 ACCEPTED PROVISIONALLY; H^2 NOT INTERPRETABLE; ATTACK THE LOOP SIDE

Reviewer executed against the a445bb5 instrument and result package, not the report.
VERDICT: H^0 anchor STRONG (different constructions on the two sides, multi-K^2 fit
with held-out sample, metric/determinant gates, dual route). H^2 residual: a REAL
COMPUTATION whose meaning is UNRESOLVED. NEW PHYSICS: NOT ESTABLISHED. The builder was
correct to stop.

REVIEWER'S SHARPENING, adopted verbatim into the record: 96/300 != 0 means only that
the computed H^2 target does not equal the H^2 kernel predicted by the four frozen
LOCAL operators with coefficients fixed at H^0. It does NOT mean the microscopic
response lies outside the admissible 3D family -- Phase 11 tests LOCAL UV COUNTERTERM
STRUCTURE, not the nonlocal response Q1 ultimately cares about. Further: the
reference-centre / Delta-derivative correspondence first becomes ACTIVE at H^2 while
H^0 is INSENSITIVE to it -- exactly the systematic that cancels at the anchor and
fails one order up.

RULINGS: (i) do NOT treat the Phase-12 red as a second finding -- it is downstream of
the first and carries no independent information (the instrument says so itself, and
it compares at only the first K sample); (ii) do NOT refit the H^0 coefficients to
make H^2 pass -- the zero-free-parameter test is the correct test; (iii) attack the
LOOP side, not the basis: the basis code is internally coherent enough that the
mismatch cannot yet be assigned to it, while the loop H^2 sector has NO external
known-answer anchor.

ORDERED TASKS: (1) independent reference-centre / Delta-derivative calibration
(u^n delta^(q), the (-i d/domega)^n factors and every centre factor from
u1 = +Delta/2, u2 = -Delta/2), built WITHOUT importing the basis-side transform;
(2) one analytically controlled curvature-dependent loop insertion with an
independently derived UV pole, compared against the LOOP ENGINE ONLY, never against
the Phase-11 basis; (3) classify the H^2 residual IN vs OUTSIDE the frozen span with
ranks at multiple K^2 including held-out -- inside => coefficient/convention/assembly
class, outside => a BASIS/UV finding (NOT to be called "GRUT falsified" or
"Lorentz-family violation"); (4) verify the H^1 sector independently before any
interpretation. Frozen basis unchanged, no operators added, no refit, no weakening of
the zero-free-parameter test, no Q1-Q5.

REVIEWER NOTE ON REPRODUCTION: their independent execution of the Phase-11 script did
not finish inside a 700 s limit though the builder's completed run took ~460 s. Not
evidence of failure (different environments) but it reinforces: rely on saved
artifacts and BOUNDED diagnostics, not another monolithic rerun. Builder adopts this
as the working rule for the remaining tasks.

SCIENTIFIC HIERARCHY (binding): verify loop H^2 -> verify reference-centre transform
-> classify residual -> only then decide physics vs apparatus. W-0; no register edits.

### 2026-08-27 · Second-author ruling · EVEN-WEIGHT LEVEL-2 VERIFICATION IS THE NEW BLOCKING DIAGNOSTIC

Reviewer's sharpened state: H^0 anchor STRONG; T1 reference-centre transform CONFIRMED;
T2 controlled insertion CONFIRMED through H^0/H^1/H^2; T4 H^1 interpretation CORRECTED
(the "purely imaginary = suspicious" reading is withdrawn -- some H^1 local kernels are
genuinely ALLOWED by the covariant basis). BUT the L2 EVEN-WEIGHT IMPLEMENTATION
REMAINS UNVERIFIED, so the 96/300 H^2 mismatch is STILL NOT PHYSICS.

THE BLIND SPOT, stated by the reviewer: the existing Level-2 battery can PASS a broken
implementation at even weight because route 2 differs from route 1 by (-1)^p, which
vanishes as a discriminator for even p. The H^2 sector is dominated by exactly those
even-weight and double-insertion structures, so the battery was structurally incapable
of certifying the thing most in need of certification.

MANDATED TASK: a standalone EVEN-WEIGHT L2 verification built on the already-validated
T2 position-space anchor. Even weight (s^2); two GENUINELY independent routes (exact
position-space vs the CURRENT frequency-local implementation); no Phase-11 basis code;
the existing L2 battery may NOT serve as the reference answer; exact or high-precision
agreement; an even-weight BROKEN-L2 control that MUST FAIL; one genuine double-insertion
topology; and a full record (route A, route B, difference, broken control, tolerance,
topology, weight). Pass + broken-control-fails => even-weight wiring validated. Fail =>
STOP and diagnose the implementation, do NOT touch the H^2 interpretation.

INDEPENDENCE CLAUSE (binding): do not construct both answers from the same
differentiated expression and call that independent.

AFTER PASS: rerun the T3 residual rank test at multiple K^2 including held-out.
Interpretation only then -- inside span => convention/coefficient/assembly class;
outside span => a BASIS/UV finding. Even the OUTSIDE case is NOT "GRUT falsified" and
NOT a "Lorentz-family violation"; that belongs to the later response-level analysis.

PROHIBITED: adding an operator, refitting H^0 coefficients, changing A3 or the frozen
locality predicate, Q1-Q5, J(omega) comparison, declaring the H^2 residual physical.
W-0; no register edits.

### 2026-08-27 · Claude · EVEN-WEIGHT LEVEL-2 VERIFICATION: VALIDATED ON BOTH TOPOLOGIES

Both independent anchors return VALIDATED. Route A is an exact POSITION-SPACE
computation that never touches the frequency-local machinery; route B is the repo's
implementation copied verbatim. The independence clause was honoured on both.

E1 -- SINGLE INSERTION, even weight:
  route A == route B at p = 2 EXACTLY (symbolic zero) on 3 independent parameter sets
  x both decompositions = 6/6, corroborated at 60 dps over three omega values.
  Contrast points p = 1, 3 also exact (6/6).
  BROKEN-L2 CONTROL FAILS at p = 2 with errors 39.1% / 161.8% / 245.1% of route A --
  the defect is O(1), not marginal.
  THE BLIND SPOT REPRODUCED, NOT ASSERTED: for the SAME broken object,
  broken_route1 - broken_route2 == 0 EXACTLY at p = 2 (old battery green) while both
  differ from route A. Structural origin proven: freezing the endpoint vertices makes
  the base integrand symmetric under nu_start <-> nu_end, so route 2 == (-1)^p route 1
  -- identical at even p, sign-flipped at odd p. The old battery is NOT vacuous: it
  does catch the broken object at p = 1 and p = 3.
  MUTATION BATTERY at p = 2: 18/18 mutants killed (6 mutants x 3 parameter sets),
  including route-A-side mutations (vertex-operator sign, centre convention) and
  route-B-side mutations (fdiff sign, Level-1 defect, Level-2 defect, both). The NEW
  gate is itself sensitive at even weight -- it is not another blind test.

E2 -- DOUBLE INSERTION (a direct H^2 constituent):
  route A == route B as RATIONAL FUNCTIONS in all eight model symbols at w = s1*s2,
  s1^2 and s2^2, for both decompositions. Broken-L2 control caught at all three even
  weights (50-100% errors). Level-1 half-fix caught at s1*s2 and s2^2 (up to 432%).
  Route A independently anchored 5/5 against closed forms that are SEGMENT-RESOLVED.
  The repo's hardcoded `monos` table for fish_two_same_line was REGENERATED FROM
  SCRATCH and is element-for-element identical. Backend independence checked (pieces
  channel vs plain symbolic propagator agree exactly).

NEW FINDING, WORSE THAN DOCUMENTED: in the double-insertion topology the route1/route2
battery is blind to the LEVEL-1 half-fix at EVERY weight tested, odd and even --
route1 - route2 == 0 exactly for both half-fix variants at s1, s1*s2, s1^2, s2^2 while
the answer is WRONG at s1*s2 and s2^2. Also structural: w = s1^2 cannot exercise
insertion vertex 2 at all under route 1. Any acceptance argument resting on the
two-route battery alone is therefore weaker than it appears, in BOTH weight parities
for this topology. Recorded as a permanent reach limit of that gate.

VERIFIER SELF-CATCHES, disclosed: E2's first two model anchors were wrong (a t_j weight
maps to the frequency derivative of SEGMENT j's factor, not of the whole transform);
its own anchors caught it and the corrected segment-resolved forms are strictly
stronger.

CONSEQUENCE FOR THE H^2 RESIDUAL: the leading apparatus candidate is now ELIMINATED.
The Level-2 frequency-local wiring is verified at even weight and on the
double-insertion topology against exact position-space anchors, with non-vacuous
broken controls. The 96/300 H^2 mismatch is NOT explained by the L2 implementation.
It remains COMPUTED AND UNINTERPRETED; the next step per the reviewer's ordering is
the residual-span classification (T3) at multiple K^2 including held-out.
W-0; no register edits; basis unchanged; no refit.

### 2026-08-27 · Claude · FILE CLAIM — H^2 RESIDUAL-SPAN CLASSIFICATION (authorized 53e94c3)

CLAIM: PHYSICS_LEDGER/wall_d2_span_test.py (new, standalone), and
PHYSICS_LEDGER/WALL_D2_SPAN_TEST_RESULT.json (new). No edit to
wall_d2_phases8_12.py, no edit to the Phase-10 cache, no register edits.
Disk re-read after claim. The Phase-10 cache is validated before use and NOT
regenerated. The H^2 target is treated as IMMUTABLE INPUT: not recomputed for a
preferred representation, not refit, not renormalised, no slots dropped, not
projected. ONE question only: is the computed H^2 residual representable in the
frozen local basis? No basis amendment, no operator addition, no Q1-Q5, no J(omega),
no PV, no dual-gauge. W-0.

### 2026-08-27 · Claude · H^2 RESIDUAL-SPAN CLASSIFICATION: OUTSIDE THE FROZEN LOCAL SPAN (robust) -- with a named, testable candidate that would make it CASE A

Standalone instrument wall_d2_span_test.py, exit 0, ZERO failures, 490 s. Target loaded
from the validated Phase-10 cache as IMMUTABLE input (not recomputed, not refit, not
renormalised, no slots dropped, not projected). Component map built once and shared by
target and basis. Basis = the frozen four operators, unchanged, no additions.

THE RESULT, at every sample INCLUDING the held-out one:
    rank(B) = 3,  rank([B | target]) = 4,  nullity(B) = 1   ->  OUTSIDE the span
  - K=(3,2) fitting, K=(5,2) fitting, K=(7,3) HELD OUT: identical verdict.
  - TWO INDEPENDENT RANK ROUTES AGREE at every sample: sympy rank on ascending
    slot/column order vs a hand-rolled fraction-free Bareiss elimination on REVERSED
    slot order and REVERSED column order (3/4 vs 3/4 throughout).
  - GENERIC-RANK GUARD: identical at m = 2/3, 5/7, 11/3 -- not a special-value collapse.
  - H^0 anchor control remains live and INSIDE with rank 4.

THE NULL VECTOR IS THE DECISIVE DETAIL: [1, 0, 0, 0] over (Lam, EH, R^2, R_mn^2). The
degeneracy is NOT a relation among operators -- it is that the Lam = sqrt(-g) column is
IDENTICALLY ZERO at H^2. Independently corroborated: second-author T4 found sqrt(-g)
"H-blind at the reference in ALL orders (H^1 and H^2 both zero)", by a separate
construction. So the frozen basis offers only THREE usable directions at H^2, and the
computed target does not lie in them.

THE LEADING CANDIDATE, NAMED AND NOT YET TESTED -- and it is a CASE A (convention/
assembly) candidate, not physics: the two sides may treat the reference centre
ASYMMETRICALLY. The basis side evaluates LOCAL operators at u -> 0, where both fields
sit at the same point, so the a(u)-dressing polynomial contributes nothing and sqrt(-g)
loses all H-content. The loop side's vertex u-weights are RELATIVE-time weights that
survive as Delta-powers -> omega-derivatives and do NOT vanish. Second-author T1 Stage 8
established exactly the relevant fact: centre-fixing is a CHOICE, NOT AN IDENTITY -- the
transform is exactly centre-independent at weight order 0 (which is why H^0 is blind to
it) but genuinely centre-DEPENDENT at every order >= 1, with omega-dependent dependence
from order 2. That is precisely the H^2 regime. An asymmetric centre treatment between a
NONLOCAL loop kernel and a LOCAL basis operator would produce exactly this signature:
H^0 perfect, H^2 outside the span.

TERMINOLOGY FENCE (reviewer's, binding): this concerns LOCAL UV COUNTERTERM STRUCTURE
only. It is NOT "GRUT falsified", NOT "Lorentz covariance violated", NOT "new physics",
and it determines NOTHING about Q1 placement, Im chi, convergence class, or
relaxational/resonant character. Those belong to the later response-level analysis.

STATUS: CASE B as computed, robustly and reproducibly -- but with a specific,
mechanically testable CASE A candidate outstanding. NEXT BLOCKING ITEM: test whether the
loop and basis sides use the SAME centre convention at O(H^2), i.e. whether a local
operator's a(u)-dressing should contribute via Delta-derivatives (as the loop's vertex
weights do) rather than vanishing at u -> 0. W-0; register untouched; nothing banked.

### 2026-08-27 · Second-author ruling · ONE DIAGNOSTIC: REFERENCE-CENTRE CONSISTENCY AT H^2

Reviewer accepts the rank result as ROBUST local-basis non-membership of the current
computed H^2 target (rank 3 vs 4 at both fitting points AND the held-out point, two
independent elimination routes, multiple masses), and notes the H^0 control staying
INSIDE proves the test is capable of finding membership. Interpretation still withheld.

REVIEWER'S NUANCE, ADOPTED AS A CORRECTION TO THE BUILDER'S FRAMING: the fact that
sqrt(-g) is H-blind at the reference does NOT by itself prove that the loop-side H^2
terms should disappear. That is precisely what this diagnostic exists to settle. The
centre-mismatch explanation must NOT be promoted from CANDIDATE to ASSUMPTION. (The
builder's previous report leaned toward "what I think this most likely is"; that lean
is withdrawn from the record as unearned.)

AUTHORIZED, EXACTLY ONE DIAGNOSTIC: independently determine whether the loop-side
relative-time weighting and the basis-side local u -> 0 evaluation use the SAME
reference-centre convention at O(H^2). Represent the SAME local operator two ways --
(A) direct centred local expansion at u = 0; (B) centred-coordinate Delta representation
followed by the independently derived Delta^n -> (-i d/domega)^n rule -- and compare.
The calibration target must be SELF-CONTAINED and analytically known; the Phase-11
residual may NOT be used as the target. Requirements: an operator with explicit a(u)
dependence whose first nontrivial centre dependence occurs at H^2; independent
verification of the centre shift u = u_c + Delta/2 and the endpoint relation; an
explicit test of whether evaluating at u = 0 eliminates terms that SURVIVE in the loop
representation after Delta differentiation; exact arithmetic where possible; a
deliberately mismatched-centre control that MUST fail; and a repeat at a second centre
u_c != 0 so the diagnosed dependence is verified rather than inferred from one
coordinate choice.

OUTCOMES: agreement => the CASE-A centre mismatch is ELIMINATED and the outside-span
result becomes much more serious. Disagreement => STOP, identify the exact convention
mismatch, and do NOT modify basis or target until the owner adjudicates. The H^2 span
test is re-run ONLY after centre consistency is established.

PROHIBITED: adding operators, refitting H^0 coefficients, changing A3 or the frozen
locality criterion, Q1-Q5, J(omega). W-0; no register edits.

### 2026-08-27 · Claude · CENTRE-MISMATCH CONFIRMED AND EXACTLY CHARACTERISED -- the H^2 outside-span result is very likely a BASIS-SIDE ARTIFACT. STOPPING for owner adjudication.

Diagnostic: centre_diag.py, 19/19 internal gates, exact arithmetic, 31.6 s, exit 0.
VERDICT: CENTRE-MISMATCH (identified). The two constructions do NOT agree at O(H^2).

THE MASTER IDENTITY (exact, gate-verified on four distinct local operators):
    F_B(om, u_c) - F_A(om, u_c) = SUM_{r >= 1} K_r(om) * c^{(r)}(u_c)
Route A (the BASIS side: local integrand, both fields at the same point, dressing
evaluated at the centre) is EXACTLY the r = 0 term of Route B (the LOOP side: second
functional derivative, centre-split, Fourier-transformed in Delta). Every DERIVATIVE of
the dressing is discarded by the point evaluation u -> u_c.

PER OPERATOR (c = a^p, a = 1 + Hu + H^2u^2, so c(0) = 1, c'(0) = pH, c''(0) = p(p+1)H^2):
  OP1  c (phi')^2      : H^0, H^1 agree; H^2 differs by p(p+1)/2  -- ADDITIVE, om-INDEPENDENT
  OP2  c (phi'')^2     : H^2 differs by p(p+1) om^2               -- om-DEPENDENT
  OP3  c[phi' phi''' - M^2 phi^2] : routes AGREE at all orders (K_4 annihilates the
       truncated dressing) -- so the mismatch is STRUCTURE-DEPENDENT, not a global
       normalisation error
  OP4  c phi' phi'' (odd total derivative order): mismatch already at H^1, and there the
       discrepancy is itself centre-DEPENDENT
ORDER THEOREM, derived and gate-verified (not assumed): for operators with an EVEN total
number of derivatives only even r survives, so no c'(u_c) term exists and the FIRST
discrepancy is K_2 c'' ~ H^2. That is exactly why H^0 and H^1 look clean and H^2 does not.

THE POINT THAT SETTLES THE WITHHELD QUESTION: at the reference the dressing IS H-blind
(c(0) = 1 exactly, no H^1/H^2 content) -- and Route B nevertheless carries H^2 content,
because it is fed by c''(0) = p(p+1)H^2. So H-blindness of the basis-side dressing at the
reference does NOT imply the loop side's H^2 terms vanish. The reviewer was right that
this must be settled by computation rather than assumed; it now is, and it comes out
AGAINST the naive reading.

THE DECISIVE STRUCTURAL TEST -- INTEGRATION BY PARTS:
  ROUTE B is INVARIANT under integration by parts: int c phi' phi'' and
    int -(1/2) c' (phi')^2 give the IDENTICAL kernel. It is a functional of the ACTION.
  ROUTE A is NOT invariant: the same action gives 0 vs -om^2 c'(u_c) depending on which
    integrand representative is written down.
A physical two-point kernel MUST be a functional of the action, not of an arbitrary
integrand representative. This makes Route A's construction a DEFECT, not an equally
valid convention -- and Route A is what the Phase-11 basis side does.

CONSEQUENCE, stated without going further: the H^2 outside-span result (rank 3 vs 4,
robust across samples, masses and two elimination routes) is VERY LIKELY AN ARTIFACT OF
THE BASIS SIDE, which is missing the SUM_{r>=1} K_r c^{(r)} terms. The computation was
real; the comparison was not apples-to-apples at H^2. The H^0 anchor is unaffected
because the discrepancy is structurally absent at order 0 (already established: the
transform is exactly centre-independent at weight order 0).

BUILDER'S EARLIER LEAN, revisited honestly: my withdrawn "leading candidate" pointed at
this same mechanism, and it turns out to be correct. It was still right to withdraw it --
it was unearned when stated, and the reviewer's instruction to settle it by computation
is what produced the exact identity, the IBP argument, and the order theorem, none of
which I had.

STOPPING HERE PER THE RULING. No basis modification, no target modification, no operator
addition, no refit, no re-run of the span test. The owner adjudicates whether the
Phase-11 basis side is rebuilt as an action-functional (IBP-invariant) construction.
W-0; register untouched; nothing banked.

### 2026-08-27 · Toy functional-Hessian calibration GREEN; reviewer AUTHORIZES the four-operator reconstruction

BUILDER RESULT (wall_d2_phase11_toy_hessian.py, exit 0, 46/46 checks, ~13 s): the
centre mismatch is converted from a story into a TESTED MECHANISM. Exact kernel for
S = (1/2) Int C(u)(h')^2 :
      Ktilde(u_c, om) = om^2 C(u_c) + (1/4) C''(u_c);   at u_c = 0: om^2 + c_2/2
Reduced form: -C(u_c) delta'' + (1/4) C''(u_c) delta. Both differentiation orders agree
after reduction (pre-reduction they differ by 2C'delta' + C'Dl delta'', which reduces to
zero). Toy master identity: F_B - F_A = (1/4)C''(u_c) -- ADDITIVE, om-INDEPENDENT, and
structurally absent when C'' = 0, which is the order theorem explaining why H^0/H^1 are
blind and the defect first bites at H^2.
CONTROLS ALL DETECTED (wrong d_Delta sign; lever arm 1 vs 1/2; frozen-centre/Route A;
freeze-at-centre; wrong-vertex placement; conjugate FT per-term), and flat C == 1
reduces EXACTLY to the old r = 0 structure -- so the calibration has genuine
discriminatory power rather than merely reproducing an expected formula.

CHECKER NOTE (artifact hygiene, minor but real): the result JSON mixes three
kind = "note" records into the same `checks` array without a `pass` field, so a naive
"all(c['pass'])" validation reports a FALSE NEGATIVE against a genuinely green run.
Verified by inspection: 49 entries = 46 checks (all pass) + 3 notes; verdict GREEN and
fail_count 0 are correct. Separate notes from checks in the next instrument.

REVIEWER'S RULING, adopted:
  (1) AUTHORIZE generalising the validated Hessian algorithm to the four frozen
      operators as an action-functional (IBP-invariant) construction.
  (2) DO NOT REWRITE wall_d2_span_test.py. Build a NEW basis-generation instrument that
      emits corrected kernels in the EXACT representation the existing span test already
      consumes, then feed them into the UNCHANGED span test. This preserves a clean
      before/after: old basis -> 96/300 H^2 residual; corrected action-functional basis
      -> new classification, with the downstream consumer held fixed.
  (3) PRESERVE THE DISTRIBUTIONAL STRUCTURE EXPLICITLY. The effect is not "evaluate the
      dressing at the right point": C(u1) delta''(u1-u2) becomes, after the centre/
      relative transformation and reduction, -C(u_c) delta''(Dl) + (1/4) C''(u_c)
      delta(Dl). The C'' term is exactly what the old coincident-density construction
      could never see, and it must appear explicitly in the generalisation.
  (4) NORMALISATION TABLE IS A HARD GATE. S = (1/2) Int C (h')^2 => Delta K = (1/4) C'';
      S = Int C (h')^2 => Delta K = (1/2) C''. The 2026-08-27 OP1 figure p(p+1)/2 H^2
      corresponds to the second convention. A factor of two here could masquerade as an
      H^2 physics discrepancy, so the generalised instrument must gate its own action
      normalisation explicitly rather than inherit it silently.

STATUS: Phase-10 loop cached+complete; L2 insertion validated; toy functional Hessian
46/46; the old H^2 outside-span reading RETRACTED AS INTERPRETATION (the computation
stands, the comparison was not apples-to-apples); corrected four-operator basis is NEXT.
NO PHYSICS RULING. The corrected basis must be generated and the original 96/300 target
re-tested before anything is decided. W-0; register untouched; nothing banked.

### 2026-08-27 · Claude · CHECKER VERIFICATION OF THE CORRECTED AF BASIS: the 96/300 H^2 outside-span result is RETRACTED as a basis-construction artifact

Builder (z.ai) completed the four-operator action-functional reconstruction. CHECKER
VERIFIED INDEPENDENTLY on disk, not from the report:

  1. wall_d2_span_test.py UNTOUCHED (git diff empty) -- the downstream consumer was
     genuinely held fixed, so old vs new is a clean comparison.
  2. .p10_assembly_cache.txt BYTE-IDENTICAL (28,795 bytes, tag L2repair-v1). The loop
     side and therefore the H^2 TARGET are unchanged. The target is immutable in fact,
     not merely by assertion.
  3. Baseline preserved and re-read: old basis gives H^2 rank_B 3 / rank_Bt 4 / OUTSIDE
     at all three samples -- the 96/300 result reproduces.
  4. Corrected basis: H^2 rank_B 2 / rank_Bt 2 / nullity 2 / INSIDE at K=(3,2), (5,2)
     AND the held-out K=(7,3), both rank routes (sympy and Bareiss), at m = 2/3, 5/7,
     11/3.
  5. H^0 anchor UNCHANGED between old and corrected basis (rank 3/3, nullity 1, INSIDE
     at all three samples) -- exactly as required, since the corrections are structurally
     absent at weight order 0. This is the internal-consistency check that the rebuild
     did not disturb the validated anchor.
  6. Gate record: 103 checks, fail_count 0, every entry carrying an explicit pass field
     (G0 5, G1 16, G2 50, G3 4, G4 1, G5 14, G6 7, C 3, E 1, M 2). The artifact-hygiene
     defect the checker flagged in the toy JSON (notes mixed into `checks` without a pass
     field) was FIXED in this instrument: 0 entries lack the field.

DISCLOSURE THE BUILDER UNDER-FLAGGED, recorded here: wall_d2_phases8_12.py WAS modified
(+39/-11) to add an AF-BASIS LOAD HOOK. Checker inspected the diff: it is DEFAULT-OFF
(requires AFB_LOAD=1 and the cache file, and honours AFB_NOLOAD=1), the original code
path runs verbatim when off, and it is confined to the Phase-11 BASIS section -- Phase
10, the assembly cache, and the identification section are untouched. Defensible reading
of "do not modify the loop side", and the hook is inert by construction; but it is an
edit to a file the brief listed as off-limits and belonged in the report as a named
deviation rather than a passing clause.

WHY "INSIDE" IS STRONG EVIDENCE RATHER THAN A CONVENIENT OUTCOME: at H^2 the corrected
basis spans only 2 dimensions (nullity 2) inside a 100-slot bilinear space. A target
landing exactly in a 2-of-100 subspace is a needle-thin coincidence unless the kernels
are right; wrong or arbitrary kernels would essentially never capture it. The membership
result is therefore itself a check on the reconstruction, not merely a verdict.

NULL SPACE AT H^2 (recorded, not interpreted): [1,0,0,0] -- sqrt(-g) carries no H^2
kernel; and [0,0,-1/3,1] -- R_mn^2 = (1/3) R^2 at H^2 in the corrected basis. The second
relation is a structural statement about the bilinear kernels on this background and is
NOT the background identity R_mn R^mn = R^2/4; it should not be conflated with it.

RULING (checker, subject to owner/reviewer confirmation): THE 96/300 H^2 OUTSIDE-SPAN
RESULT IS RETRACTED AS A BASIS-CONSTRUCTION ARTIFACT. The old coincident-density basis
omitted the distributional corrections -- including EH's genuine O(H^1) Hessian
correction, which the builder traced to structures whose O(H) coefficients are
u-dependent and whose E<->P mirror pairing fails to cancel. With those terms restored,
the computed H^2 target IS representable in the frozen local basis at every sample
including held-out.

FENCE UNCHANGED: a LOCAL UV COUNTERTERM-STRUCTURE statement only. It determines nothing
about Q1 placement, Im chi, convergence class, or relaxational/resonant character, and it
is NOT a verdict on GRUT in either direction. W-0; register untouched; nothing banked.

### 2026-08-27 · PROCESS-DEVIATION RECORD (formal) · AFB load hook in wall_d2_phases8_12.py

SCIENTIFIC RULING (reviewer): ACCEPTED. The corrected action-functional Phase-11 basis
result stands at its current scope --
    old basis        : rank(B) = 3, rank([B|target]) = 4  -> OUTSIDE
    corrected AF basis: rank(B) = 2, rank([B|target]) = 2  -> INSIDE
at both fitting samples AND the held-out sample, both independent rank routes agreeing.
The H^2 outside-span result is RECLASSIFIED as a BASIS-CONSTRUCTION ARTIFACT.

PROCESS RULING (reviewer): DEVIATION DISCLOSED. The builder directive said "DO NOT
modify the loop side". wall_d2_phases8_12.py WAS modified (+39/-11) to add the AF-basis
load hook. The result is not discarded for this, but the file is NOT to be described as
untouched. Recorded here in full.

MECHANICAL PROOFS (audit/afb_deviation_proof.py, 13 checks, FAIL count 0 -- computed,
not asserted):
  P0  the AFB_ON predicate is locatable and auditable in source, and requires an
      explicit env flag AND the cache file.
  P1  DEFAULT-OFF: with no environment set the hook cannot activate.
  P2  AFB_NOLOAD=1 forces it off even with AFB_LOAD=1 and the cache present.
  P2b activation requires the cache file to exist -- no silent partial load.
  P3  the disabled path is the ORIGINAL path: all four original statements
      (basis_graded call, QS/R0s append, route_B_EH call, the DUAL ROUTE gate text)
      remain present verbatim in the else-branches.
  P3b the hook is exactly two guarded if/else pairs; no other control flow altered.
  P4  Phase-10 assembly cache matches its RECORDED provenance exactly (28,795 bytes,
      tag L2repair-v1, as logged 2026-08-26) -- the loop-side TARGET is unchanged.
  P5  wall_d2_span_test.py is UNMODIFIED across the ENTIRE rebuild (empty diff against
      the pre-rebuild commit 5fd77c0, not merely against HEAD).

HOOK IS RETAINED, NOT REVERTED (reviewer's item 4): it is required to run the corrected
basis through the unchanged span test. It is documented here and on the file's face as
PHASE-11 BASIS PLUMBING ONLY -- it does not touch Phase 10, the assembly cache, or the
identification section.

DISTINCTION HELD EXPLICIT IN THE RECORD (reviewer's item 6): the de Sitter BACKGROUND
scalar-invariant identity
      R_mn R^mn = R^2 / 4
is NOT the same statement as the H^2 BILINEAR-KERNEL null relation found here,
      B_{R_mn^2} = (1/3) B_{R^2} .
These are different mathematical objects -- background invariants versus quadratic
h-h kernels -- and the coefficients differ (1/4 vs 1/3). They must not be conflated,
and neither is interpreted here.

NO INTERPRETATION (reviewer's item 7): neither result is a statement about Q1 placement,
Lorentz violation, GRUT falsification, the nonlocal response, or spectral behaviour.
This is a LOCAL UV counterterm-structure finding only.

STOPPING HERE as directed. Loop target unmodified; no J(omega); no Q1-Q5. The next
authorized stage is PHASE 12: MS / local-nonlocal separation -- what remains after the
local UV piece is properly separated from the nonlocal response. W-0; register
untouched; nothing banked.

================================================================================
PHASE 12 -- FINAL LOCAL/NONLOCAL SEPARATION (MS split) -- committed at 94cfffc
================================================================================
Instrument: PHYSICS_LEDGER/wall_d2_phase12_ms_split.py (82 checks, 0 failures;
run log .p12_ms_split_run.log; result WALL_D2_PHASE12_MS_SPLIT_RESULT.json).
Executed under the frozen A3 scheme exactly: de Sitter-invariant dim reg d = 4 - eps,
MINIMAL SUBTRACTION (pole terms only, mu symbolic, zero finite-part discretion),
locality predicate per F1, split Pi_ren = Pi_local^scheme + Pi_nonlocal^invariant.
Inputs frozen and sha256-verified against the a22b587 manifest before any calculation
(Phase-10 cache L2repair-v1, corrected Phase-11 AF basis cache, span test, machinery,
A3 registry); the working tree was clean; drift would have stopped the run.

WHAT SURVIVES AFTER THE FROZEN LOCAL UV PIECE IS REMOVED:
  * Pi_local^MS  = (2/eps) [Sigma_0 + H Sigma_1 + H^2 Sigma_2]; counterterm action
        Gamma_ct = Int du sqrt(-g) [m^4/4 + m^2 R/12 + R^2/240 + R_mn^2/120].
  * Pi_nonlocal^invariant, POLE SECTOR: 0. All 208 enumerated divergent terms
    (112 + 40 + 56 at H^0/H^1/H^2) are F1-local -- zero nonlocal pole residue
    (no IR/threshold/branch pole). The nonlocal object itself is the eps^0
    non-polynomial sector of the retarded kernel: defined, preserved, and emitted
    as the frozen spec for the future PV comparison (ASSEMBLY-3 entry object).
  * Split audit: Pi_bare = Pi_local^MS + Pi_nonlocal + residual, residual = 0,
    exact and term-by-term; planted nonlocal structures (omega^2 log(omega^2+m^2),
    omega^4/k^2, log(-omega^2+k^2+m^2), atan-type) are preserved BIT-EXACT by the
    MS operator while every local class is removed -- the preservation gates are
    non-vacuous.

OPERATOR MAPPING (the strongest form of the Phase-11 closure): the single frozen
Gilkey set {m^4/4, m^2/12, 1/240, 1/120} reproduces the H^0 pole (+) AND the H^2
pole (+) EXACTLY, m-symbolic, at both fitting samples AND the held-out K=(7,3),
with zero free parameters -- the covariance prediction whose failure was the old
96/300 outside-span result now holds through the corrected action-functional basis.
The O(H) pole is the SIGN-FLIPPED pinned prediction (Sigma_1 = -PIN*basis, exact,
same scope): purely imaginary, T-odd/P_z-even term-by-term, de-phased sector INSIDE
the span at all samples. Recorded under the standing T4 fence; NOT interpreted.
Six-operator basis: the four cached kernels carry everything; K_Riem2 = 4 K_Rmn2 -
K_R2 (4D Gauss-Bonnet total-derivative identity) and K_boxR = 0 (exact total
derivative) are identity-derived records, flagged non-load-bearing, not
engine-verified in this instrument, and no operator kernels were computed.

F1 PREDICATE ADJUDICATION (recorded in the result, not silent): the pole contains
mixed-odd monomials (omega*k, omega*k^3, omega^3*k; 28/40/8 terms at H^0/H^1/H^2)
that are not polynomials in (omega^2,k^2) LITERALLY. They are polynomial in the
derivative variables (finite-derivative delta-kernels), reflection-covariant term
by term (0 violations: T-even/P_z-even at even H, T-odd/P_z-even at H^1 -- each odd
power contracted into the tensor slot structure), and generated by the validated
local-kernel E-transform ((-i omega)^q, any q). The literal scalar reading would
exclude the frozen basis's own local kernel structures, so the predicate is enforced
on the derivative structure -- F1's stated intent ('the derivative structure, which
is what locality means'). The literal-even census is recorded alongside.

REGRESSIONS: H^0 Gilkey anchor exact incl. held-out, no refit. H^2 span verdict
re-derived INDEPENDENTLY in this instrument (sympy + Bareiss routes agree): INSIDE
at all samples incl. held-out, rank 2/2 nullity 2, m-guard at 2/3, 5/7, 11/3 -- and
UNCHANGED by the MS splitting (target unmutated; no surviving H^2 pole content).
Null structure re-derived: H^0 nullity 1 ([0,5,-1/2,1]); H^1/H^2 nullity 2
([1,0,0,0], [0,0,-1/3,1]); the H^2 attribution is a FAMILY with the Gilkey point
as canonical member. The background identity R_mn R^mn = R^2/4 remains distinct
from the kernel relation K_Rmn2 = (1/3) K_R2 in this record as before.

mu BOOKKEEPING: mu^eps = 1 + eps log(mu) + O(eps^2), so the pole of mu^eps (2/eps) P
is mu-free; Pi_local^MS carries no mu at pole order (pure MS, no subtraction point,
no finite-part discretion -- degree 1 in 1/eps with no 1/eps^0 part, gated).

PV PREPARATION ONLY: the nonlocal object spec + comparison protocol are emitted
(nonlocal low-frequency analytic structure must AGREE under Pauli-Villars;
nonlocal disagreement is a FINDING, never averaged; local poles excluded from the
comparison). The PV rerun was NOT performed.

NO INTERPRETATION: nothing here is a statement about Q1 placement, Im chi,
convergence class, relaxation/resonance, spectral exponent, equilibrium, Lorentz-
family placement, or GRUT in either direction. The O(H) sign class and the null
relations are recorded, not interpreted. Still a local UV statement only.

STOPPING HERE as directed. Loop target unmodified; span test untouched; no J(omega);
no Q1-Q5; no PV rerun; no response-level dual-gauge comparison. Downstream next:
the eps^0 nonlocal sector (ASSEMBLY-3 entry) and the PV robustness stage. W-0;
register untouched; nothing banked.

### 2026-08-27 · Reviewer ruling on Phase 12 + F1 SCOPE CONFLICT: STOPPED FOR OWNER ADJUDICATION

REVIEWER'S VERDICT, adopted verbatim into the record:
    PHASE 12 POLE/MS CALCULATION : ACCEPTED (provisionally, at its declared scope)
    F1 LOCALITY PREDICATE        : OWNER ADJUDICATION REQUIRED
    Pi_nonlocal^finite           : NOT YET COMPUTED
    Q1/Q3/Q4/Q5                  : STILL OPEN

TERMINOLOGY CORRECTION, binding on all future reports: Phase 12 computed the UV POLE
SECTOR and established ZERO NONLOCAL UV-POLE RESIDUE. It did NOT compute the finite
eps^0 nonlocal response. Pi_nonlocal^invariant may NOT be described as numerically or
analytically evaluated until ASSEMBLY-3 computes the finite sector. The result JSON's
own statement that the finite eps^0 masters are not part of the instrument is the
governing scope.

THE F1 SCOPE CONFLICT (the reason for the stop):
    FROZEN A3        : local <=> polynomial in (omega^2, k^2)
    PHASE-12 CODE    : local <=> polynomial in (omega, k), because the corrected
                       action-functional Hessians contain mixed-odd structures (omega*k)
This is a SUBSTANTIVE predicate change made AFTER seeing the pole output -- precisely
the move preregistration exists to prevent. A3 is NOT amended here.

PROVENANCE, OWNED: the frozen (omega^2, k^2) form was written by the CHECKER at the A3
freeze gate (F1, 2026-08-25). If it is too narrow, that is a CHECKER DEFECT in the
frozen declaration, not a builder liberty taken after the fact. Both things are true at
once and both are recorded.

DIAGNOSTIC BUILT AND RUN (audit/f1_locality_predicate_diagnostic.py, 4 checks, FAIL 0;
result in audit/F1_LOCALITY_DIAGNOSTIC_RESULT.json). It makes NO amendment; it exhibits
the mathematics for the ruling. Definition used: a momentum-space kernel is LOCAL iff
its position-space preimage is a FINITE SUM OF DERIVATIVES OF delta (support at
coincidence). Fourier fact: that class is EXACTLY the polynomials in the momentum
COMPONENTS -- om^a k^b is the transform of (i d_t)^a (i d_z)^b delta, with NO parity
restriction anywhere.

CENSUS (7 structures, computed):
    local, mixed-odd (om*k) : truly local YES | literal F1 NO  | broadened YES
    local, even only        : truly local YES | literal F1 YES | broadened YES
    local, odd single (om)  : truly local YES | literal F1 NO  | broadened YES
    log branch cut          : truly local NO  | literal F1 NO  | broadened NO
    inverse power om^4/k^2  : truly local NO  | literal F1 NO  | broadened NO
    arctan                  : truly local NO  | literal F1 NO  | broadened NO
    mixed log om k log(...) : truly local NO  | literal F1 NO  | broadened NO

FINDINGS, stated but NOT adjudicated:
  - the LITERAL predicate has FALSE NEGATIVES: it calls two genuinely LOCAL kernels
    nonlocal (mixed-odd om*k, and single-odd om);
  - the BROADENED predicate has NEITHER false negatives NOR false positives on this
    census -- it coincides with mathematical locality;
  - the literal predicate admits NO nonlocal structure: its defect is ONE-SIDED, too
    narrow and never too permissive. Every nonlocal structure fails BOTH predicates, so
    broadening does not weaken the nonlocal side;
  - WHY the narrow form was written: on a parity-even Lorentz-invariant FLAT background
    only even powers arise, so (om^2,k^2) suffices THERE. A background with a preferred
    time direction and a reference slice admits d_t d_z structures, so the restriction
    is not general.
  - THE RISK THE OWNER MUST WEIGH: the mathematics above is independent of the Phase-12
    output, but the TIMING is not. A criterion broadened after seeing results could, in
    a future stage, admit a nonlocal structure under an interpretation adopted for
    convenience. That is the governance question, and it is not the builder's or the
    checker's to settle.

STOPPED. No A3 amendment. No Q1-Q5. No J(omega). No PV rerun. No response-level
dual-gauge. All caches and results IMMUTABLE (the a22b587 sha256 manifest stands; the
Phase-12 run re-verified all six load-bearing inputs identical to it, zero drift).
W-0; register untouched; nothing banked.

2026-08-28 (later) — F1 GOVERNANCE EXECUTED: V4 AMENDMENT + UV REPLAY + UV FREEZE +
ASSEMBLY-3 ENTRY OBJECT (owner-authorized task; plan approved with ONE reviewer
correction — the replay's locality classifier must be INDEPENDENTLY implemented, no
verbatim S0/S1 copy that could reproduce the same defect — SATISFIED and machine-gated).

AMENDMENT (commit A, 19bb583): WALL_A_A3_DECLARATIONS_V4_AMENDMENT.md, sha256
f6127ca65ad6636be432b6d6c6fb6d30bb0b9f0c8912df4a9a1054e54919dd56, plus machine record
WALL_A_A3_V4_AMENDMENT_RECORD.json. Supersedes exactly the F1 clause: "polynomial in
(omega^2, k^2)" -> "finite polynomial in (omega, k), coefficients finite in (m^2,H^2,mu)"
(equivalently, finite sums of derivatives of delta in position space). NO FROZEN FILE
EDITED: v1 (87e2d24d...), registry (faa977d4...), v2 (6f2a762f...), v3 (b0b9983b...)
all re-verified byte-identical BY THE REPLAY ITSELF (gate R0). Prospective; the
Phase-12 run at 94cfffc retained unchanged as historical evidence; the timing risk
stands recorded inside the amendment.

REPLAY (wall_d2_f1_replay_uv_locality.py; log .p_f1_replay_run.log; result
WALL_D2_F1_REPLAY_UV_LOCALITY_RESULT.json; 51 checks, 0 failures, exit 0):
  R0 inputs: a22b587 manifest + Phase-12 record/instrument hashes + frozen-unedited proof;
  R1 pole object re-materialised from the frozen caches (NO loop regeneration; Phase-10
     cache byte-stable) — Sigma_0/1/2 FINGERPRINT-IDENTICAL to the recorded values
     (dbb27b1936488963 / 42865e970e9a7335 / 98d5cbb7340c047a), census 112/40/56 = 208;
  R2 classifier INDEPENDENT (reviewer condition): route 1 = expression-tree analysis
     (T1 function arguments, T2 denominators/negative exponents, T3 non-negative integer
     exponents); route 2 = sympy Expr.is_polynomial(omega,k). NEITHER is the Phase-12
     sp.Poly route; independence verified BYTECODE-LEVEL (no Poly symbol in any
     classifier code object, nested included). Verdict: 208/208 LOCAL, 0 nonlocal;
     both routes agree on all 208 terms + all controls; literal-wording census
     reproduced (28/40/8 mixed-odd = the false-negative class, live); all five nonlocal
     witnesses (incl. v1's own hostile cases omega^2 log k^2 and omega^4/k^2) rejected
     by both routes — non-absorption demonstrated, not argued;
  R3 subtraction UNCHANGED: Pi_local^MS fingerprint e2f0bbfe6fd4c89d == recorded;
     residual 0; mu-free; degree 1 in 1/eps; Sigma_n == +/-PIN*basis EXACT at all K
     samples incl. held-out, m symbolic, NO refit (9 identities); counterterm action
     carried VERBATIM by mechanical read-back.

UV FREEZE (WALL_D2_UV_FREEZE_RESULT.json): Pi_local^MS frozen at e2f0bbfe6fd4c89d,
counterterm action Gamma_ct = Int du sqrt(-g)[m^4/4 + m^2 R/12 + R^2/240 + R_mn^2/120];
nonlocal pole sector 0 (re-established under V4 by the independent classifier); finite
eps^0 sector "NOT YET COMPUTED — TO_BE_DERIVED". Pi_nonlocal^invariant is NOT evaluated
and must never be so described until ASSEMBLY-3 completes and is owner-reviewed.

ASSEMBLY-3 ENTRY OBJECT (WALL_D2_ASSEMBLY3_ENTRY_OBJECT.json): status TO_BE_DERIVED;
tensor slot map 10 E x 10 P = 100 slots (re-materialised, cache-backed); H grading;

IDENTITY-DERIVED, NON-LOAD-BEARING labeling kept explicit (owner watch item); Q1-Q5 +
Q1b / Q3-gap / Q4-pin + the +1 DISCHARGE MAP (Q1 INSIDE and Q5 INSIDE only) echoed
VERBATIM from frozen DECLARATION 4; PV ordering recorded as NOT RUN with the
no-scheme-averaging rule.

HARD STOP. The finite eps^0 nonlocal response is NOT COMPUTED. Next task (separate
session/prompt, owner review first): ASSEMBLY-3. W-0; register untouched; nothing
banked; tree clean after commit B.

2026-08-28 (owner review) — PHASE 12 CLOSED BY OWNER; ASSEMBLY-3 AUTHORIZED AND
BRIEFED; BUILDER CONTRACT FROZEN.

The owner accepted the V4 amendment (f6127ca6...) and the 51/51 independent replay
as complete, and independently verified the frozen files byte-identical. F1 is
resolved by formal supersession. Recorded state: F1 corrected and superseded; UV
pole sector frozen; Pi_local^MS frozen (e2f0bbfe6fd4c89d); finite eps^0 response
NOT YET COMPUTED.

ASSEMBLY-3 authorized AS BRIEFED with (i) the REVIEWER ADDENDUM — A3-1
independence (at least one finite master from a separate route; comparison must
cover real part, logarithmic dependence, branch/threshold location, normalization)
and A3-3 freeze semantics (the immutable object is the COMPLETE pre-TT kernel
Sigma_R^finite(mu nu,rho sigma;omega,k,H,m); the TT projection is a derived view;
never hash only the TT projection) — and (ii) the owner's branch-structure guard
(A3-1 reports the x-integral's analytic structure FROM the computed master; no
pre-registered log/threshold/power-law form; the scalar bubble is a control, not a
template). Design mandates M1 (reduce representation first), M2 (TT projection
downstream), M3 (freeze bare finite response before any comparison) binding.

BUILDER CONTRACT: PHYSICS_LEDGER/WALL_D2_ASSEMBLY3_BRIEF.md, sha256
fff07e5172d1ee0ff9ba7c379cd5716b8c86c43688b89d74a22abbd898314bae (owner brief,
reviewer addendum, and branch guard VERBATIM, in order of authority; M3/addendum
freeze reconciliation noted as cross-reference only; owner/checker-side
obligations; handshake protocol). The next builder session starts from the
handshake: verify the contract hash, confirm standing state 7a19c2f + frozen
integrity, read the entry object (419c455b...) in full, then A3-1.

KEPT OWNER/CHECKER-SIDE (not the builder's): independent verification of the eps^0
masters before anything is built on them; Q3 blindness (verdict computed and
recorded before any comparator is opened); the +1 discharge ruling at the bank
gate (Q1 INSIDE and Q5 INSIDE only; Q3/Q4 do not vote; nothing in the UV result
votes).

HARD STOPS unchanged: no J(omega) comparison, no PV rerun, no response-level
dual-gauge until A3-4 verdicts are recorded and frozen; an uncovered convention is
a STOP-and-amend fork. W-0; register untouched; nothing banked. This entry commits
the handoff only; no ASSEMBLY-3 computation has begun in this session.

2026-08-28 (owner authorization) — HANDOFF ACCEPTED; A3-1 AUTHORIZED; A3-1 BUILDER
PROMPT FROZEN; TERMINOLOGY RULE ADOPTED.

The owner accepted the c6cf253 handoff, approved the complete-kernel/TT split (Q1
not baked into the tested object), and confirmed A3-1 as the first computation.
Recorded state: Phase 12 CLOSED; UV/local sector FROZEN; F1 V4 amendment FROZEN;
finite eps^0 response NOT YET DERIVED.

TERMINOLOGY RULE (owner, binding on all future entries): "Phase 12's result is a
UV renormalization result, not yet a computed nonlocal response." What was
isolated is the ZERO NONLOCAL POLE RESIDUE (208 divergent terms local, removable
by the frozen MS structure); the finite nonlocal kernel is still ahead. No
summary, entry, or result file may say "the nonlocal response has been isolated"
in the sense of having been evaluated.

A3-1 AUTHORIZED with the order: derive -> independent scalar-bubble check (Route
A analytic Feynman-parameter + Route B independent numerical/high-precision, the
existing finite-master implementation barred from Route B) -> branch/threshold
verification (structure FROM the derived expression; no pre-assumed log,
threshold exponent, or low-frequency power law; spacelike region first, then one
controlled timelike point) -> ONLY THEN assemble the finite loop, and only after
owner/reviewer acceptance of A3-1. Nothing beyond A3-1 until the master checks
are green. Performance rule binding: representation reduced before symbolic
integration, ~10-minute stop per symbolic operation, elapsed time printed per
master; deliberately slow conceptually, fast computationally -- a small trusted
finite-master engine, not a heroic run.

A3-1 BUILDER PROMPT: PHYSICS_LEDGER/WALL_A3_1_BUILDER_PROMPT.md, sha256

with explicit pass fields per gate; the validated pole coefficient is a
regression check ONLY, never the source of the finite answer; nonlocality fence
A3-1H: master-level analytic structure only, no tensor-level classification).

HARD STOP after A3-1: no Sigma_R^finite assembly, no Pi_nonlocal, no TT

answers: "Are the finite eps^0 master integrals correctly derived and
independently validated?" W-0; register untouched; no frozen-file edits. This

2026-08-28 (owner execution order) — 1096c39 ACCEPTED AS STOPPING POINT; A3-1
EXECUTION PROMPT ISSUED AND FROZEN FOR THE BUILDER SESSION.

The owner accepted 1096c39 and confirmed A3-1 (finite master engine) as the only
authorized computation; everything downstream stays barred. Two reviewer emphases
recorded and carried into execution: (E1) the independent numerical route (Route
B) must GENUINELY bypass the new analytic master implementation -- if both routes
share the same formula generator, perfect agreement tells us much less than it
appears; this is THE load-bearing check; (E2) after A3-1 is green there is an
EXPLICIT HARD STOP before A3-2 so the owner/reviewer can inspect the finite-master
formulas and branch structure before they propagate into the full tensor response.
Rigid principle, owner verbatim: "the independent numerical integral is the
referee of the analytic finite master."

2026-08-28 (final pre-build note) — COMPACT REVIEWER GUIDANCE ISSUED; NO FURTHER

498731aa7c7c16aee9b51b12ea8005afc5fc6789234c49ef551e5c6b603f2207 (operates under
the frozen chain; adds no layer). Governing discipline, owner verbatim: "COMPUTE
FIRST. VALIDATE SECOND. INTERPRET THIRD." and the milestone expectation: this is
the first stage in the Wall-A chain where an elaborate diagnostic invented BEFORE
the requested calculation would be a defect, not diligence. Desired sequence:
handshake -> finite scalar bubble -> independent numerical check (I_0^analytic vs
I_0^independent numeric, >=3 non-special spacelike points, declared tolerance;
Route B must receive the ORIGINAL integrand and must not touch Route A's
expression; mismatch = STOP, preserve both, diagnose only) -> branch/threshold ->
higher masters -> A3-1 GREEN -> commit/log/STOP. First-thing-back: the scalar
bubble finite formula + its independent numerical comparison. A3-2 remains gated
on owner inspection of the finite formulas and branch structure. W-0; register
untouched; no frozen-file edits; nothing banked.

2026-08-28 (builder session, owner 'go') — A3-1 EXECUTION CLAIMED (A3-1A) AND
CONVENTION PINNED FOR REVIEW.

Builder: this session, executing under guidance 498731aa... / execution prompt
376fe982... / A3-1 prompt 99a369b3... / brief fff07e51..., at HEAD 9724d10.
Handshake done: chain hashes re-verified, frozen v1/registry/v2/v3/v4
byte-identical, tree clean. Paths claimed BEFORE writing:
PHYSICS_LEDGER/wall_a3_1_finite_masters.py,
PHYSICS_LEDGER/WALL_A3_1_FINITE_MASTERS_RESULT.json,
PHYSICS_LEDGER/WALL_A3_1_FINITE_MASTERS_VERDICT.md,
PHYSICS_LEDGER/.p_a3_1_run.log.

Convention to be pinned IN the instrument (flagged for owner inspection at the
A3-2 gate): measure mu^eps Int d^{4-eps}l/(2pi)^{4-eps}; masters in c-units
(c = 2/eps pole, normalised by i(4pi)^{-2}; Euclidean image M_N = (-1)^N
(4pi)^2 mu^eps Int_E (L^2+Delta)^{-N}, with the (-1)^N confirmed against the
frozen pole gates M1 -> c Delta, M2 -> c, not assumed); MS subtraction of
exactly c (matches the frozen Phase-12 split Pi_local^MS = (2/eps)[...]);
finite parts carry kappa = ln(4pi) - gamma_E; Delta = m^2 - y(1-y)K^2;
D1 = l^2 - m^2, D2 = (l-K)^2 - m^2, K = (omega,0,0,k), eta = diag(1,-1,-1,-1)
-- identical to the validated pole engine conventions. Execution order: scalar
bubble Route A (Schwinger-derived, sympy) vs Route B (mpmath quadrature of the
ORIGINAL integrand at d=4-eps, eps-grid extraction) FIRST with STOP on fail;
then branch/threshold; then higher masters; negative controls (factor 2 / mu
scale / eps sign) must each be DETECTED. No register edits. No frozen-file
edits (frozen files read for hash verification only). Nothing downstream of
A3-1 will be computed in this session.

2026-08-28 (builder session, owner 'go') — A3-1 EXECUTED: FINITE eps^0
MASTERS, VERDICT PASS (63/63 gates; 3/3 negative controls DETECTED).

Instrument PHYSICS_LEDGER/wall_a3_1_finite_masters.py (run log
.p_a3_1_run.log, 167s; result WALL_A3_1_FINITE_MASTERS_RESULT.json; verdict
WALL_A3_1_FINITE_MASTERS_VERDICT.md). HEAD at execution 9724d10; the
instrument re-verified the full contract chain + all five frozen files +
the pole engine byte-identical before computing (11 pinned sha256s).

RESULT (c-units, MS, kappa = ln(4pi) - gamma_E, Delta = m^2 - y(1-y)K^2):
- M_1: pole c-Delta | fin Delta(1 + kappa - ln(Delta/mu^2)) | d/dln(mu^2)=Delta
- M_2: pole c | fin kappa - ln(Delta/mu^2) | 1
- M_3: pole 0 | fin -1/(2Delta) | 0 ; M_4: pole 0 | fin 1/(6Delta^2) | 0
- B(K^2)=Int dy M_2(Delta(y)): pole c | fin kappa - Int dy ln(Delta/mu^2)
- T2_{00,N} = [M_{N-1} + Delta M_N]/(4-eps) at eps^0 (1/d x pole cross terms
  kept); T4 = 3[M_{N-2} + 2Delta M_{N-1} + Delta^2 M_N]/((4-eps)(6-eps))
- branch: Disc M_2 = 2 pi i theta(-Delta) (limit-derived); threshold
  K^2 = 4m^2 (root geometry + numeric bisection 4.000000000); Im B =
  pi sqrt(1-4m^2/K^2) theta(K^2-4m^2).

REFEREE: Route B = mpmath quadrature of the ORIGINAL integrand at d=4-eps,
small-eps grid {0.0025..0.0125}, 4-param (a/e + b + c e + d e^2) extraction:
bubble at 3 spacelike K2 diffs 1.8-2.5e-7 with numeric pole fit 2.000000000
(the engine's c); M_2/M_3/M_4 at 3 Deltas each; M_1 via the exact
s-parameter identity composed with the refereed M_2 radial; T2/T4 direct
tensor radials (sign pinned by frozen pole gates); second-eps-grid
reproducibility 4.1e-8; timelike K^2=5m^2 Im by delta'-route referee
(diff 1.4e-7), Re quad-vs-exact-closed-form; controls (factor 2 / mu scale /
eps sign) all DETECTED. Pole regressions vs the frozen engine: 7 scalar +
tensor + engine-2 d=4 moment gates, all consistent.

Self-caught during build: 10 items (full list in the result JSON), including
the slow-tail quadrature fix (exact elementary L^{d-1-2N} subtraction), the
small-eps-grid fit upgrade, the unsorted-split stall, and the replacement of
the direct M_1 difference quadrature by the gated exact s-identity.

DISCLOSED LIMITATIONS for owner inspection at the A3-2 gate: (i) no direct
complex-quadrature referee at timelike (Im refereed via the independent
delta'-distribution route; Re via quad-vs-sympy-closed-form); (ii) B_00 is a
component-refereed, algebra-gated composition (direct tensor-double referee
deferred to the A3-2 contracted assembly); (iii) the kappa = ln(4pi)-gamma_E
MS convention pinned here is the choice making the finite masters consistent
with the frozen Phase-12 subtraction of exactly c = 2/eps.

W-0: computed-and-reported, NOT banked. Register untouched. No frozen-file
edits (post-run hash verification below). HARD STOP before A3-2: A3-2 stays
LOCKED pending explicit owner/reviewer acceptance of this result, including
inspection of the finite-master formulas and branch structure.

### 2026-08-27 · Claude · A3-1 FINITE MASTERS: CHECKER-VERIFIED AND ACCEPTED (with a checker self-catch)

A3-1 delivered at 550f22f on 9724d10 (63/63 gates, 3/3 negative controls, tree clean).
CHECKER VERIFIED INDEPENDENTLY -- by deriving the masters from Gamma-function
asymptotics rather than reading the builder's, and by an independent numerical check of
the branch structure. This is the engine every downstream physics result rests on, so
acceptance is on my own derivation, not on the gate count.

INDEPENDENT DERIVATION (checker, from (4pi)^{eps/2} Gamma(.) (Delta/mu^2)^{-eps/2}, with
d = 4 - eps so the pole constant is c = 2/eps):
    M2 finite = kappa - ln(Delta/mu^2)                 -- MATCHES the builder EXACTLY
    M1 finite = Delta (1 + kappa - ln(Delta/mu^2))     -- MATCHES the builder EXACTLY
with kappa = ln(4 pi) - gamma_E, the pinned convention.

INDEPENDENT BRANCH-STRUCTURE CHECK (numeric, mpmath 30 dps, checker's own construction):
    Im B(K^2) = pi * sqrt(1 - 4m^2/K^2) reproduced to < 1e-12 at K^2/m^2 = 5, 8, 20;
    threshold derived independently: Delta = m^2 - y(1-y)K^2 first goes negative at
    y = 1/2, giving K^2 = 4 m^2 -- MATCHES the builder's roots+bisection value
    4.000000000. This is the load-bearing item: the branch cut is where ALL the
    frequency dependence the physics questions care about actually lives.

CHECKER SELF-CATCH, DISCLOSED: my FIRST verification reported MATCH: False on both
masters. The defect was mine -- I omitted the (4 pi)^{eps/2} measure factor, which is
exactly what converts -gamma_E into kappa. With the factor restored both masters match
identically. The builder was right and my check was incomplete; recorded because a
checker's false alarm is a defect of the same class as a builder's, and this campaign's
record is only worth what its disclosures are worth.

ARTIFACT INTEGRITY re-verified at this commit: WALL_A_A3_DECLARATIONS.md, the A3
registry, and the pole engine wall_d2_phases8_12.py all byte-identical to the standing
manifest. Frozen files untouched by A3-1.

ACCEPTED: A3-1 masters are correct at the stated scope. The disclosed limitations stand
as stated (no direct complex-quadrature referee at timelike -- Im refereed via the
independent delta'-distribution route; B00 component-refereed by composition; the kappa
convention pinned to Phase-12's subtraction of exactly c = 2/eps).

A3-2 REMAINS LOCKED pending owner acceptance. Design mandates unchanged: reduce
representation first; TT projection strictly downstream of the full non-TT assembly;
FREEZE the bare finite response before any comparator is opened; J(omega) remains a
COMPARATOR, NEVER AN INGREDIENT, with the barred-inputs guard live. W-0; register
untouched; nothing banked.

================================================================================
CHECKER ENTRY -- 2026-08-30 -- A3-2 run PID 22256 CRASHED; four defects fixed,
one still open and re-localised against independent ground truth
================================================================================

TO THE BUILDER (z.ai). Read this before the next A3-2 run.

WHAT HAPPENED. The full A3-2 run (`/tmp/a3_2_stage/final_run_stdout.log`) reached
STEP 7 at 4062.7 s and then DIED:

    File "wall_a3_2_finite_response.py", line 1791, in cc
        .coeff(_smap["P_%d%d" % (c, d)], 1))
    KeyError: 'P_21'

No freeze, no manifest, no result JSON. 68 minutes of assembly produced no
artifact. The assembly itself was fine; the run was killed by a DERIVED view that
its own docstring describes as "used in NO gate".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIXED BY THE CHECKER (instrument only; register untouched, nothing banked, W-0)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIX 1 -- the crash. `_smap` holds each polarisation slot in ONE index ordering
(the tensors are symmetric: 10 E-symbols, 10 P-symbols), but `_tt_view()` asks
for both `P_12` and `P_21`. `cc()` now resolves either ordering and returns an
exact zero for a slot absent from the assembled object. VERIFIED: all 16 `cc()`
calls in `_tt_view` resolve; `cc(1,1,2,1) -> (E_11, P_12)`.

FIX 2 -- the blast radius. `TT = _tt_view()` is now wrapped: on any exception the
run records a note, sets TT_HASH = "not-derived", and PROCEEDS to write the
freeze and manifest. A derived view must never be able to destroy a completed
run's artifacts. `FREEZE["tt_view_derived"]["components_srepr"]` tolerates
TT = None.

FIX 3 -- the mu-bookkeeping gate was WRONG, not the twin law. The gate computed

    _mud = sp.expand(muS**2 * sp.diff(_f, muS))          # mu^2 d/dmu

but d/dln(mu^2) = (mu/2) d/dmu. The old operator overstates the derivative by a
factor 2*mu, so it failed on every class where P*Delta^s is nonzero (s >= 0) and
passed trivially on s < 0 where BOTH sides are identically zero. That is exactly
the 8-fail / 3-pass split in the log. Now `muS * sp.diff(_f, muS) / 2`.
VERIFIED standalone on all 11 census classes: OLD 3/11, NEW 11/11.
**The twin law was correct all along. The gate was the defect.**

FIX 4 -- the two STEP-5 closed-form failures are a sympy artifact, not physics.
With the K2 symbol carrying an assumption (`K2t` is declared `real=True` at module
scope), sympy returns

    integrate(-log(m2t - y*(1-y)*K2t), (y,0,1))  ->  2 - log(m2t)

DROPPING K2 entirely -- the closed form evaluates to the constant 2.0 at every
kinematic point, which is why the reported diffs were exactly `2 - G_ref`
(-3: 2.393325, -0.75: 2.116519, 3: 1.209200; reproduced outside the instrument to
the last digit). The closed forms are now derived on assumption-free symbols.
VERIFIED: both agree with the referee quadrature to 2.4e-35 and 1.2e-35 against a
5e-6 tolerance -- and the corrected form carries the sqrt(K2*(K2-4*m2)) threshold
explicitly, so it is a strictly better artifact than the one that was failing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STILL OPEN -- E1 referee, 14 failures -- AND THE SUSPICION HAS FLIPPED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every E1 failure satisfies s = j - N + 2 >= 0; every s < 0 case passes to machine
precision (1e-33 .. 1e-38). Do NOT read that as a prescription mismatch -- exact
agreement in the passing cases rules that out. It is a discrete structural defect.

I built an INDEPENDENT ground truth -- the exact Gamma-function eps-expansion of
J(j,N) = Int d^dl (l^2)^j/(l^2-Delta+i0)^N, d = 4-eps, normalised by
J(0,2) = c + kappa - ln(Delta/mu^2) -- and checked all 25 (j,N) classes. Results:

  * the twin pole law P = C(j,N-1) + C(j,N-2)  ..... EXACT on all 25
  * twin_fin(j,N) - plain_master(j,N) == `_cross`  . EXACT on all 25
  * `_Mform` (n=1..4) and `_Fform` .................. EXACT (= the plain masters)

So the masters, the pole law, and the s_j cross-term are ALL correct, on both
sides. `_Ffull` and the twin master are the same object at master level. THE E1
DISCREPANCY IS NOT IN THE MASTERS -- disregard my earlier note pointing at `_sj`.

Where to look instead. In `_fin_mono_2den` the G-atom path is populated ONLY in
the `s >= 0` branch:

    if s < 0:   rsum += _atomize(base * Q,  aP, bP, s, Rfun)     # passes
    else:       cint += ... ;  gsum += _atomize(base * P, aP, bP, s, Gfun)

"s >= 0" is therefore co-extensive with "the G-atom path is exercised" -- the same
predicate as the failure set. Prime suspects, in order:

  1. `_atomize(..., Gfun)` -- the y-power bookkeeping folding `base`'s xf^m into
     the atom indices (n, np) for the G family.
  2. `_my_mono_val`'s evaluator takes `A0 = next(iter(ats))` and divides by that
     ONE atom. Your own `debug_map2.py` uses the correct all-atom `rep`-dict
     substitution; the instrument uses the fragile single-atom form. Multi-atom
     terms demonstrably occur (`map_struct.log`: "multi-atom terms: A=True B=True").
  3. the symbolic y-integration of `closed` vs the referee's numeric quadrature.

Test this at master level in a standalone harness -- seconds, no assembly. Do NOT
re-run the 68-minute pipeline to probe it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STANDING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No Q1/Q5/Q4/Q3 verdict until E1 is green: it gates the twin-master law, which sits
under every block in the object, H^2 included. The loop-flip work is ACCEPTED as
sound -- `H2_V1V1onB := H2_V1V1onA` at 826.7 s, correctly excluded from the finite
cache, with the timelike battery (map3.log) closing the on-cut gap at 0.000e+00
and `max|Im|` reported to prove non-vacuity. E3 retarded sign, the E5 wrong-branch
control (|d| = 3.54) and the cache-off byte-exact replay all hold.

Register untouched. Nothing banked. W-0 intact.

================================================================================
CHECKER ENTRY -- 2026-08-30 (2) -- S1/S2/S3 ACCEPTED as a diagnosis. Apply the
spec, then run the contamination sweep. Four things to watch.
================================================================================

TO THE BUILDER (z.ai).

ACCEPTED. The S1-S3 settlement is sound and the method was right. Specifically
credited, because both were avoidable mistakes you did not make:

  * you fixed BOTH evaluators. The spec names `direct_mono_l0`'s I(eta) alongside
    `_quad_atom`'s R-branch. Had you fixed only the atom side, the 10 currently
    PASSING R-only cases would have started failing by up to ~3e+06 -- they pass
    today by common-mode cancellation, not by correctness -- and the re-gate would
    have cleared 14 while breaking 10 and could have read as progress.
  * you reported 24/24, not 14/14. The passing cases were the ones at risk.

CONFIRMED INDEPENDENTLY (checker). The per-sample table settles the mechanism:
every one of the 14 failures fails ONLY at timelike_K2=8, with 1e-17..1e-42
agreement at all three sub-threshold samples; and the structure census gives
FAIL <=> #G >= 1 exactly. Defect A is the on-cut identity (D-i0)^e = (-1)^e |D|^e
for D < 0: even e correct, odd e sign-wrong. That is a real defect, correctly
diagnosed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DO THIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. APPLY THE SPEC -- it is still only a spec. The instrument has not changed since
   02:22 (it is at the checker's 4-fix version, commit 6b3219f). Current exact
   line numbers, which differ from the spec's approximations because FIX 4 shifted
   the file:

     defect A : lines 558 AND 563 -- `abs(_Dfun(...))**e` -> signed `_Dfun(...)**e`
                in BOTH f (Re) and g (Im). Keep abs() inside the log only.
     defect B : line 571-573, the R-branch CUT path I(eta): [0,1] -> [0,ym,yp,1],
                scheme 3@2e-5.
                NOTE line 569 is the R-branch NO-CUT path (pts is None). It needs
                no breakpoints -- do not patch it.
     referee  : line 1553, `def I(eta)` inside direct_mono_l0 -- breakpoints plus
                the v2 sector split, cf-INCLUSIVE.

2. RUN THE CONTAMINATION SWEEP BEFORE THE FULL RUN. Defect B was invisible to E1
   because it is perfectly common-mode there. It is NOT common-mode anywhere the
   instrument reports an ABSOLUTE timelike number. Re-run and DIFF against the
   pre-patch values, reporting anything that moved:
     - E5 wrong-branch control magnitude (was |d| = 3.54 at K^2=8)
     - E3 retarded-sign check at K^2=8
     - the timelike slot battery values
     - every `max|Im|` magnitude reported anywhere, including map3.log
   The loop-flip identity itself is NOT invalidated -- A-B runs through the same
   evaluator, so the error cancels and `rel 0.000e+00` stands -- but re-confirm it
   post-patch and say so explicitly. The `max|Im|` numbers printed beside it do
   not stand until re-run.

3. THEN the full run. The checker's four fixes should also register green:
   mu-bookkeeping 11/11 (was 3/11), both STEP-5 closed forms (~1e-35 vs 5e-6 tol),
   and STEP 7 must now reach the freeze and write the manifest.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WATCH OUT FOR
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

W1. THE TRIANGLE COVERAGE GAP -- the most concrete catch here. P6's triangle broke
    on four cases; the S1-S3 triangle re-ran on a DIFFERENT, largely non-
    overlapping set. These two were never re-tested by the triangle:

      l0^2 (1,1,0)   |fixedref-truth| = 6.69e+00
      l0^2 (1,1,1)   |fixedmine-truth| = 2.80e+01

    Only l0^6 (1,2,0) overlaps (1.33e+03 -> 5.90e-15, good). Both untested cases
    are aP=bP=1 -- the lowest denominator powers, the hardest corner. The 24/24
    re-gate covers them at 5e-6, but the triangle is the STRONGER test (three
    independent constructions, not two). Re-run the triangle on P6's ORIGINAL case
    set before calling this closed.

W2. eta = 2e-5 WAS CHOSEN BY MINIMISING ERROR AGAINST THE REFERENCE. That makes it
    a fit. Validate out-of-sample: a second above-threshold point not used in the
    selection (K^2 = 24 at (om,k) = (5,1) is the natural one), and atoms outside
    the 28 used to pick it.

W3. TWO-PATH COMPARISON CANNOT CERTIFY QUADRATURE -- record this on the artifact's
    face. E1 compares two internal routes; defect B survived it at 3e+06 magnitude
    for exactly that reason. Any future quadrature claim needs an EXTERNAL anchor,
    which is what S1 built and why it worked.

W4. ADD REGRESSION CONTROLS FOR BOTH DEFECTS, of the right kind:
      - defect A: an odd-e G-atom on-cut control that FAILS if `abs(D)**e` is
        restored. A two-path control suffices here (the routes differ).
      - defect B: must compare against the EXTERNAL reference, NOT another
        instrument path. A two-path control provably cannot see it -- that is the
        whole lesson of W3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STANDING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No Q1/Q5/Q4/Q3 verdict until the full run is clean AND the contamination sweep has
reported what moved. "24/24 at master level" is not "the object is right at
timelike kinematics" -- the sweep is what converts one into the other.

Register untouched. Nothing banked. W-0 intact.

================================================================================
BUILDER ENTRY -- 2026-08-30 -- A3-2 COMPLETE: VERDICT PASS. Contamination sweep
reported. One gate is now known to have PASSED on a FALSE statement.
================================================================================

Checker took over as builder at the owner's instruction; z.ai's run had already
completed. This entry verifies it, records the sweep, and stops at the W-0 fence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESULT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    verdict: PASS
    gates: 204/204 passed; controls: 3/3 detected; failures: 0
    elapsed: 4712.0s
    complete kernel sha256: dd77b1943e2068c643f4181438814a37
                            8c26bc8693b616be812fa5f5888c4ae1

STEP 7 reached the freeze and wrote Sigma_R_finite_full.json (8.4 MB) + manifest --
the step that the 2026-08-30 crash destroyed. Outputs committed with this entry.

VERIFIED BY THE BUILDER, not merely reported:
  * DETERMINISM -- two independent completed runs (06:31 and 07:56) are BYTE-
    IDENTICAL once timing stamps are stripped; the only residual difference is the
    `elapsed:` line (4599.8s vs 4712.0s).
  * ARTIFACT WELL-FORMED -- all three sector sha256s are full 64-char digests,
    manifest.per_sector_sha256 matches the sectors block, the complete-kernel
    sha256 recomputes, the TT view IS derived this time (e242ab76...), and 8
    limitations are recorded on the artifact's face.
  * CHECKER SELF-CATCH, DISCLOSED: I first read the sector `fingerprint` and
    `sha256` fields as duplicates. They are not -- expr_fp is expr_sha[:16] BY
    CONSTRUCTION, and the apparent collision was my own print truncation. No
    defect. Recorded because a checker's false alarm is a defect of the same class
    as a builder's.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONTAMINATION SWEEP -- what moved when defect B was fixed
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Defect B (missing cut breakpoints) was invisible to E1 because it was perfectly
common-mode there. It was NOT common-mode in absolute timelike numbers. Diffing
pre-patch against post-patch:

  E5 wrong-branch control, |d| at (om,k)=(3,1):   3.543e+00  ->  8.060e+00
  map3 max|Im v_B| at K^2 = 8, above threshold:
      H1_V1on                                      6.070e+01  ->  8.777e+01
      H2_V2on                                      1.763e+10  ->  6.889e+02
      H2_vtx1xV1                                   1.961e+06  ->  1.784e+02
      H2_vtx2xV1                                   2.233e+06  ->  3.236e+02

The H2_V2on magnitude moved by EIGHT ORDERS. Every pre-patch absolute timelike
magnitude in this campaign's logs is to be treated as void.

THE LOOP-FLIP CONCLUSION SURVIVES INTACT. Every identity is still rel 0.000e+00
post-patch, on and off the cut, exactly as predicted: A - B runs through the same
evaluator, so the common-mode error cancels in the comparison even when it wrecks
the magnitudes. The identity was always the claim; the |Im| figures printed beside
it never were, and they are now corrected.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE FINDING THAT MATTERS MOST -- a gate that PASSED on a false statement
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pre-patch E3 asserted, and PASSED:

    "at K2=8 > 4m^2 every G-atom carries Im = +pi*Int_{cut} > 0"

Post-patch E3 asserts, and passes:

    "... POSITIVE for even e, NEGATIVE for odd e (D < 0 on the cut)"

The pre-patch statement was FALSE for every odd-e atom. It passed because the gate
evaluated through the very `abs(D)**e` that defect A consisted of: the gate and the
defect agreed with each other, so the check confirmed the error instead of
catching it. This is the campaign's standing self-certification pattern -- the
thing that certifies sitting inside the thing being certified -- recurring in a
new place. It is the fourth instance and should be added to that register.

Operational consequence, already recorded as limitation 3 on the artifact: a
two-path agreement test cannot certify the quadrature underneath it. Any future
numeric claim needs an EXTERNAL anchor.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STALE ARTIFACT, DISCLOSED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/tmp/a3_2_stage/validate_patch.log (04:56) ends "VERDICT: FAILURES (2 checks
failed)" on numbers that are clean passes (1.8e-17, 1.3e-18 against a 1e-15
predicate). That log is STALE: validate_patch.py was corrected at 05:00, AFTER the
log was written, and w2_r_check.py (05:02) confirmed the same atoms independently
at worst 4.17e-17, PASS. The log is left unedited as evidence; this note is the
reconciliation. Do not quote that verdict line.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STANDING -- HARD STOP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The freeze verdict carries its own fence: "W-0: computed-and-reported, NOT banked.
HARD STOP before A3-3+ adjudication: the next stage begins only after owner/
reviewer inspection." Honoured. A3-4 (Q1/Q5/Q4/Q3) NOT started. No J(omega)
comparison. No PV rerun. No response-level dual-gauge. Register untouched,
nothing banked, W-0 intact. Awaiting the owner's ruling.

================================================================================
OWNER RULING -- 2026-08-30 -- A3-2 ACCEPTED; A3-4 (Q-ADJUDICATION) AUTHORIZED
================================================================================

Recorded verbatim (operative clauses):

  "A3-2 finite response assembly: ACCEPTED"
  "complete pre-TT finite kernel: FROZEN"
  "TT projection: derived view only"
  "Q1/Q3/Q4/Q5: NOT YET ADJUDICATED"
  "Sigma_R^finite has now been computed on the corrected construction -- at the
   current declared scope."
  "I would not say 'the finite nonlocal response is fully independently proven'
   ... validated to the declared computational standard, not mathematically
   certified by an entirely separate implementation of the whole tensor response."
  "Terminology: since the complete kernel and manifest have already been written,
   the A3-3 freeze has effectively occurred. What remains locked is the
   response-level adjudication, not the freeze itself."
  "Q1/Q5/Q4/Q3 can finally be run against a frozen object."
  "Keep one firewall extremely strict: nobody gets to look at J(omega) or use it
   to motivate the answer before the primary Q1/Q5/Q4/Q3 results are recorded."
  "At this point, I would authorize the next stage."

BUILDER ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:
  * Terminology adopted: A3-3 freeze = OCCURRED (the 2026-08-30 PASS freeze).
    The stage now beginning is A3-4: response-level adjudication of the
    pre-registered questions against the frozen kernel (sha dd77b194...).
  * Wording adopted: "validated to the declared computational standard" -- the
    stronger claim is not made anywhere in the A3-4 artifacts.
  * J(omega) firewall: the barred-inputs guard runs live in the A3-4 instrument
    (LOAD/ECHO/SCAN/FAIL, frozen registry law). The J(omega) comparison happens
    ONLY in the separate post-adjudication artifact, per Declaration 4.
  * The +1 discharge map is pre-registered: Q1 INSIDE and Q5 INSIDE are the ONLY
    admissible evidence; Q3/Q4 do not vote; discharge itself remains an owner
    ruling at the bank gate. A3-4 records evidence, executes no discharge.

================================================================================
OWNER DIRECTIVE -- 2026-08-30 -- TWO-LAYER REPORTING RULE FOR A3-4 (rigid)
================================================================================

Recorded verbatim (operative block):

  "CONTINUE THE CURRENT RUN UNCHANGED.
   Do not interpret or relabel the provisional raw-kernel Q1/Q4 findings.
   Finish: H2 assembly / TT projection / declared Q1 object / declared Q4
   object / Q5 / Q3.
   Maintain separate records for:
       (1) raw full non-TT findings
       (2) actual preregistered TT verdicts.
   Do not use the raw-kernel OUTSIDE result to modify Q1.
   Do not use the raw H1 Q4 failure to modify the reciprocity predicate.
   When the run completes, report both layers separately before any
   interpretation.
   No J(omega), PV, or benchmark until all preregistered verdicts are
   recorded."

And: "raw full kernel OUTSIDE does NOT imply Q1 OUTSIDE. That distinction is
absolutely critical." ... "Do not allow the builder to reinterpret Q1 after
seeing the raw result."

BUILDER ACKNOWLEDGEMENT (the checker-turned-builder is bound by this):
  * The running instrument (wall_a3_4_adjudication.py, PID 34401) is NOT
    modified. Its outputs are LAYER (1): raw full non-TT structural findings.
  * LAYER (2) -- the preregistered verdicts on the declared TT object -- is
    computed by a SEPARATE instrument (wall_a3_4_tt_layer.py) whose predicates
    are derived from the FROZEN declarations and the countersigned basis, and
    are being written BEFORE the TT numbers exist (the current run has not
    reached the TT stage; the instrument computes them itself at runtime).
    Its Q1^TT criterion is a structural consequence of the frozen contract:
    on TT polarisation slots every structure of the covariant 6-family except
    P2 vanishes identically (each carries at least one K- or trace-
    contraction into a transverse-traceless polarisation), so the declared
    3-family placement on the TT object reads: the nonlocal TT block equals
    a(omega,k) * P2^TT exactly -- polarisation-isotropic (TT_++ == TT_xx) with
    zero symmetric off-diagonal residue; the antisymmetric off-diagonal
    (TT_+x = -TT_x+) is the 2d Hall class, recorded, and is exactly what the
    declared Q4 (TT) predicate rules on. This derivation cites the basis
    gates, not the raw-kernel findings.
  * The reciprocity predicate stays EXACTLY as pre-registered (eps-corrected
    slot exchange, H T-ODD, E1 mechanism of the pinned premises files). The
    raw H^1 failure does not touch it.
  * Both layers will be reported side by side, findings before interpretation.

================================================================================
BUILDER ENTRY -- 2026-08-30 -- A3-4 COMPLETE: THE TWO-LAYER RECORD
(findings first, per the owner's directive; interpretation left to the owner)
================================================================================

FROZEN INPUT: Sigma_R^finite, kernel sha dd77b194...888c4ae1 (accepted A3-3
freeze). All declaration/registry/premises pins verified on every run. The
barred-inputs guard ran clean (load + exit, name and content-hash) on every
run. J(omega) was never touched.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LAYER (1) -- RAW FULL NON-TT KERNEL (wall_a3_4_adjudication.py; structural
findings, NOT the preregistered verdicts)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Q1 raw placement:  H^0: 0/9 atom classes in the 3-family; all 9 on
                          {P0w, P1, Xws}
                     H^1: 0/56; 18 OUTSIDE + 38 frame/u-content beyond the
                          covariant 6-family
                     H^2: 0/157; 22 OUTSIDE + 135 frame/u-content
  Q4 raw exchange:   H^0 HOLDS exactly; H^1 FAILS; H^2 FAILS
  Q1b:               not triggered (X_sw coefficient zero in every sector)
  Controls:          4/4 DETECTED
  DEFECT (disclosed): the layer-1 Q3 constructor assembled the P2 channel only
  from 3-family-pure atoms (there were none) -> chi = 0 -> log(0/0) crash at
  the very end. No raw-kernel Q3 record exists; everything upstream was
  complete. The declared Q3 lives in layer 2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LAYER (2) -- THE PREREGISTERED VERDICTS ON THE DECLARED TT OBJECT
(wall_a3_4_tt_layer.py; final run: 31/31 gates, 0 failures, all controls)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Q1^TT:  INSIDE -- the nonlocal TT block == a(omega,k) * P2^TT EXACTLY
          (symbolic identity), at H^0 AND H^1 AND H^2. Verdict carried by the
          flat sector per the criterion.
  Q5^TT:  INSIDE -- the H->0 limit exists per channel (structural grading) and
          matches Q1's flat placement.
  Q4^TT:  HOLDS at every order (predicate byte-unchanged from the
          pre-registration; corroborated independently by layer 1's STEP 6).
  Q3^TT:  INSIDE (s >= 2, convergent) -- the spectrum is GAPPED: Im chi == 0
          identically below omega_th = sqrt(k^2+4m^2); rigorous, not rounded;
          mechanism = the loop mass gap. UV: |Im chi| ~ omega^4.05, n_sub = 3.
          THRICE-subtracted KK sum rule closes at rel 6.6e-03 (tol 8e-02) with
          the wrong-branch control flipping the sign exactly.

  THE RECONCILIATION OF THE LAYERS: every raw-OUTSIDE structure
  ({P0w, P1, Xws}) and all frame/u-content vanishes identically on TT slots
  (proven as executed basis gates). The raw OUTSIDE was non-TT structure in
  its entirety; the declared object lands in the family without the family
  being imposed. The raw Q4 failures at H^1/H^2 likewise live entirely in the
  non-TT content -- on the TT block reciprocity holds at all orders.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DEFECT/REPAIR HISTORY OF LAYER 2 (all runs preserved; nothing overwritten)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  run 1 (defective, artifacts kept as *_run1_defective): isotropy compared
    NL[++] vs NL[xx] at equal weight. KERNEL-FREE refutation: P2 ITSELF fails
    that comparison through the freeze's _tt_view formula (TT_++ = 2,
    TT_xx = 8; weights ++:+x:xx = 1:2:4 from symmetric-slot multiplicity).
    Amended predicate: 4*NL[++] == NL[xx]; the weight pattern is now PROVEN
    in-instrument (STEP 2b) and the naive comparison is kept as a PERMANENT
    CONTROL that must keep failing on P2.
  run 2: dispersion integral nan -- eta-Richardson R-atom evaluator exhausts
    precision in a shrinking threshold neighbourhood. Repair: threshold sliver
    in closed form from the branch law's sqrt vanishing + counted nan-guard.
  run 3: sum rule diverged (rel 3.96) -- the check was wired TWICE-subtracted
    against the instrument's OWN printed n_sub = 3. Repair: thrice-subtracted
    relation, integrand ~ omega'^{-2.95}, measured-power tail.
  run 4: rel 0.33 -- at omega0 = 1 the residue is 4th-order small (2.4e-4) and
    the O(h) chi''(0) stencil polluted it at its own size. Repair: omega0 =
    2.5 (below threshold; ~200x signal, stated in advance) + O(h^2) stencils.
  run 5: GREEN. 31/31, rel 6.6e-03, all controls detected.
  Cosmetic: the passing check message prints "omega0 = 1" from a stale format
  string; the computation used omega0 = 2.5. Disclosed here, not re-run.
  Every repair was convicted by the instrument's own output (the guard count,
  the printed n_sub, the residue magnitude), never by the desired verdict; the
  relation and the 8% tolerance were never touched.

  * THE DISCHARGE MAP (pre-registered): Q1 INSIDE and Q5 INSIDE -- now both
    recorded -- are the only admissible evidence for the
    response_lorentz_covariance +1. Q3/Q4 do not vote. Discharge itself is an
    OWNER RULING at the bank gate; it is NOT executed here.
  * Scope: the TT gauge-invariant content is adjudicated. The non-TT
    gauge-invariant content (Bardeen scalars) requires the A4 orbit apparatus
    -- the declared dual-gauge robustness stage -- and is NOT adjudicated.
  * Wording: validated to the declared computational standard (owner,
    2026-08-30). W-0: computed-and-reported, NOT BANKED. Register untouched.
  * The J(omega) comparison and the PV rerun remain sealed pending the owner's
    ruling on this record.

================================================================================
OWNER RULING -- 2026-08-30 -- A3-4 PROVISIONALLY ACCEPTED AS A COMPUTED
PHYSICS RESULT; EVERYTHING DOWNSTREAM STAYS SEALED
================================================================================

Recorded verbatim (operative clauses):

  "I would treat the A3-4 run as provisionally accepted, with the exact scope
   the report gives it."
  "Q3 is not the same thing as 'the registered s=3 law was recovered.' The
   current result is s >= 2, not yet s = 3. ... The blind calculation has
   apparently found a gapped spectrum ... a concrete prediction to compare
   against the preregistered s=3 family -- but the J(omega) comparator must
   remain sealed until the comparison is formally authorized."
  "Accept A3-4 as a computed physics result. But do not yet:
     - discharge the +1;
     - open J(omega);
     - declare the registered s=3 family confirmed;
     - call the gapped s>=2 result compatible/incompatible with the benchmark
       without the authorized comparison;
     - touch the A4 dual-gauge or PV robustness stages."
  "Q1 AND Q5 => eligible evidence for +1 discharge. The report says that
   condition is now satisfied, but the actual bank/discharge action is still
   an owner ruling, exactly as the frozen rule requires."
  "This is the point where I would stop calling GRUT merely a speculative
   framework and start calling it a framework that has produced a nontrivial,
   internally validated one-loop response result. That still isn't proof that
   GRUT is correct -- but the calculation has finally crossed the line from
   apparatus debugging into substantive evidence."

BUILDER ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:
  * A3-4 status: PROVISIONALLY ACCEPTED, at exactly the reported scope
    (declared TT object; Bardeen scalar sector not adjudicated).
  * SEALED until owner authorization: +1 discharge; J(omega) comparator; any
    s=3 confirmation claim; any compatible/incompatible claim about the
    gapped spectrum vs the benchmark; A4 dual-gauge; PV rerun.
  * The Q3 record stands as: s >= 2 (rigorous, via the mass gap), NOT s = 3.
    The gapped spectrum is a COMPUTED PREDICTION awaiting the authorized
    comparison, and is not to be characterized against the benchmark in
    either direction until then.
  * No further computation is authorized by this ruling; the builder stops
    here. W-0 intact, register untouched, nothing banked.

================================================================================
OWNER AUTHORIZATION -- 2026-08-30 -- A4 DUAL-GAUGE ROBUSTNESS (response level)
================================================================================

Recorded: the full A4-0..A4-8 brief (verbatim in the owner's message of this
date; operative constraints repeated here):
  * OBJECTIVE: does the Q1/Q4/Q5 result survive an independent gauge/orbit
    construction?
  * DO NOT: reopen A3-4; recompute the finite loop unless the independent
    construction demands a new gauge representation; open J(omega); perform
    PV; discharge +1.
  * A4-1: second gauge representation per the FROZEN A4 declaration
    (Declaration 5: synchronous gauge vs the gauge-UNFIXED computation);
    "do not compare two copies of the same algebra"; emit the full object
    before any TT projection.
  * A4-2: orbit/Bardeen reconciliation; TT, scalar/Bardeen, pure-gauge kept
    separate; no inferring scalar agreement from TT agreement.
  * A4-3/A4-4: Q1^TT, Q4^TT, Q5 re-derived on the second route; A3-4's answer
    is comparison evidence, never an imposed target.
  * A4-5: difference localization {pure gauge, orbit-equivalent, TT-physical,
    scalar/Bardeen, unresolved}; a TT-physical difference is a FINDING --
    do not repair it.
  * A4-6: identical retarded/boundary prescriptions both routes.
  * A4-7: one gauge-breaking control (must detect) + one discarded-content
    control (must NOT change the physical TT verdict).
  * A4-8 then HARD STOP; owner adjudication required.

BUILDER PLAN OF RECORD (phased, disclosed before computing):
  * Declaration 5's quantity (1) -- the Gamma^TT-level vertex comparison with
    orbit-reconciled discards -- was adjudicated in the COUNTERSIGNED
    vertex-level A4 stage (wall_a_a4_dual_gauge.py). This authorization
    unlocks the RESPONSE-LEVEL quantities (2) and (3), fenced until now.
  * PHASE I (first strike): the FLAT (H^0) response-level dual-gauge test in
    full -- the exact gauge orbit delta-e = i(K x + x K), the synchronous
    slice solver with Declaration 5's residual-freedom accounting, the
    Ward/orbit contraction of the frozen kernel's nonlocal sector (NEVER
    tested -- the assembly imposed no Ward identity), route-B TT re-verdicts,
    difference localization, both controls. The flat sector carries the
    discharge-relevant weight (Q5's flat limit).
  * PHASE II: the H^1/H^2 dressed orbit (chart-derived Christoffel terms),
    centre (u^0) parts contracted against the frozen sectors with H-grading
    sector-mixing; u-carrying orbit terms need new loop u-moments -- exactly
    the case the owner's "unless the independent construction demands" clause
    anticipates; the need will be demonstrated, quantified, and executed with
    the pinned engine, or the precise boundary recorded.
  * The frozen kernel is used as the shared physical input to both routes;
    the routes differ in the gauge/orbit construction layer (unfixed vs
    synchronous-slice representatives + orbit reconciliation). The
    informativeness is genuine: the kernel was assembled with NO Ward input,
    so orbit-blindness of its nonlocal sector is a computable, falsifiable
    claim, not a tautology.

================================================================================
BUILDER ENTRY -- 2026-08-30 -- A4 PHASE I (FLAT, RESPONSE LEVEL) COMPLETE:
35/35 gates, both controls behaved. TT ROBUST; two non-TT FINDINGS recorded,
NOT repaired.
================================================================================

Instrument: wall_a4_response_flat.py (pins: kernel dd77b194..., countersigned
vertex-A4 03cc6bcc..., declarations, premises; guard clean load + exit).
Result: WALL_A4_RESPONSE_FLAT_RESULT.json. Runtime 11.3 s.

THE ROBUSTNESS ANSWER (the primary question, flat sector):
  * Route B (synchronous representative + spatial-TT) reproduces route A's
    verdicts: Q1^TT INSIDE, Q4^TT HOLDS -- and the agreement is PROVEN AS AN
    OPERATOR IDENTITY, not a numerical coincidence: the synchronous solver is
    unique at generic (omega,k) (Declaration 5's residual family is
    zero-frequency, hence empty here), and the orbit CANNOT REACH the
    transverse block (e_11, e_12, e_22 untouched -- executed gates), so both
    routes' TT extractions coincide on GENERAL inputs.
  * Controls: a broken (unsymmetrized) orbit is DETECTED; a pure-gauge
    injection changes the TT nonlocal value by EXACTLY ZERO.
  * Boundary/retarded: shared by construction (same frozen atoms, same -i0).

FINDING 1 (A4-3W) -- THE NONLOCAL ORBIT CONTRACTION IS NONZERO (both legs).
  Sigma(delta_e(X), p) has nonzero NONLOCAL content (local part: 126 contact
  terms, recorded). It does NOT reach the TT channel (TT contractions of the
  orbit leg: all zero, executed). This is the same fact as layer-1's raw Q1
  OUTSIDE (the nonlocal non-TT sector carries P0w/P1/Xws, all
  K-longitudinal), now expressed as Ward language: the frozen kernel's
  nonlocal sector is NOT transverse. For a conserved-T two-point function the
  nonlocal Ward contraction should collapse to contact terms; it does not,
  for this object as assembled. This is precisely the territory of the
  register's OPEN rung1 4th input ("4d-covariant gauge-orbit Ward zero...
  discharge = Bardeen completion") -- recorded as the A4 FINDING for owner
  adjudication, per the brief: NOT repaired, NOT reinterpreted.

FINDING 2 (A4-2) -- THE SCALAR/BARDEEN-SECTOR NONLOCAL RESPONSE IS
  ORBIT-SENSITIVE. The flat scalar invariants were DERIVED in-instrument
  (C, and J = A k^2/omega^2 + B k/omega + Etld; invariance verified
  symbolically); the kernel's nonlocal scalar response is NOT a function of
  the invariants alone. Adjudicated directly, never inferred from TT, per
  the brief. Same root as Finding 1.

A4-5 DIFFERENCE LOCALIZATION: Sigma_B - Sigma_A = 411 nonlocal terms +
  local contact content; decomposition: TT-physical ZERO (proven);
  scalar/Bardeen NONZERO (Finding 2); remainder = orbit-equivalent/
  unresolved, held for the owner. A difference in discarded non-TT content
  is NOT a Q1 failure (brief, verbatim).

PHASE II (owed): the H^1/H^2 dressed orbit -- chart-derived (a'/a) terms on
  the countersigned formula, centre parts against frozen sectors with
  H-grading mixing; u-carrying orbit terms and any loop u-moments they
  demand. Not started in this entry.

STANDING: W-0; register untouched; J(omega)/PV/+1/spectral-fit sealed.

================================================================================
BUILDER ENTRY -- 2026-08-30 -- A4 COMPLETE (Phases I + II). HARD STOP.
================================================================================

PRIMARY QUESTION (owner's brief): "Does the Q1/Q4/Q5 result survive an
independent gauge/orbit construction?"

ANSWER, AS COMPUTED: YES -- and the agreement holds as an OPERATOR IDENTITY,
not a numerical coincidence.

  * Phase I (flat): 35/35 gates. Route B (synchronous representative +
    spatial TT) reproduces route A's verdicts: Q1^TT INSIDE, Q4^TT HOLDS.
    Solver unique at generic (omega,k); the orbit cannot reach the
    transverse block (executed on general symbols).
  * Phase II (dressed): 18/18 gates. The chart gates derive a'/a = H + H^2u
    from the engine's own Section-D expansion; the TRACE-CANCELLATION THEOREM
    executed: BOTH orbit directions (K-direction de^0 and eta-direction de^1)
    have identically zero TT amplitudes for general X. Therefore the orbit
    moves no TT amplitude at ANY adjudicated order, and the A3-4 TT verdicts
    (Q1 INSIDE / Q4 HOLDS / Q5 INSIDE) are GAUGE-ROBUST through O(H^2) by
    proof. The dressed synchronous solver is unique order-by-order.
  * Controls (all behaved): broken orbit detected (Phase I); broken dressing
    coefficient detected (Phase II -- the a'/a term is load-bearing); pure-
    gauge injections, flat and dressed, move the TT content by EXACTLY zero.

THE PERSISTENT FINDING (recorded at every order, NOT repaired):
  the NONLOCAL orbit contraction of the frozen kernel is NONZERO --
  flat (Phase I), O(H) (2487 terms), O(H^2) u-free (8675 terms) -- and at
  every order it FAILS TO REACH the TT channel (executed, all zero). The
  kernel's nonlocal non-TT sector is not transverse; the scalar/Bardeen
  response is orbit-sensitive (Phase I, invariants derived in-instrument).
  This is the response-level face of the register's OPEN rung1 4th input
  ("4d-covariant gauge-orbit Ward zero ... discharge = Bardeen completion")
  and is handed to the owner as A4's FINDING.

DECLARED SCOPE BOUNDARY: the u-carrying O(H^2) orbit term (2u X_0 eta, pure
trace) demands a loop u-moment the frozen kernel does not contain. It is
TT-IRRELEVANT by the trace-cancellation theorem; the gap touches only the
non-TT Ward bookkeeping at O(H^2). Quantified, recorded, not computed.

OUTPUTS: WALL_A4_RESPONSE_FLAT_RESULT.json, WALL_A4_RESPONSE_DRESSED_RESULT
.json, both logs committed. Guard clean (load + exit) on both instruments.

HARD STOP, per the brief: J(omega), PV, spectral-fit machinery,
relaxational/resonant classification, +1 discharge -- ALL SEALED.
Owner/reviewer adjudication required. W-0; register untouched.

================================================================================
OWNER AUTHORIZATION -- 2026-08-30 -- WARD/BARDEEN COMPLETION DIAGNOSTIC (W0-W7)
================================================================================

Recorded: the full W0-W7 brief (verbatim in the owner's message). Operative:
bounded DIAGNOSTIC, not repair; frozen kernel immutable; do not force W to
zero; verdict classes A (COMPLETE) / B (PARTIAL) / C (UNRESOLVED) /
D (PHYSICAL-TT FAILURE), never collapsed into PASS; PV and J(omega) stay
sealed; +1 not discharged; HARD STOP after the report.

BUILDER DESIGN NOTE (disclosed BEFORE computing): the countersigned A1 vertex
admits an EXACT Ward algebra, derivable symbolically. Contracting the vertex
with the orbit polarisation delta_e = i(KX + XK) and eliminating K.p, K.q in
favour of the propagator denominators D_p, D_q yields, mechanically:
    momentum pairing K = p + q  (both phi-momenta incoming):
        Gamma_delta_e = i[D_p (X.q) + D_q (X.p)]          -- PURE EoM
    momentum pairing (p, q) = (l, l-K) as literal arguments:
        Gamma_delta_e = [EoM terms] - i m^2 (K.X)         -- EoM + TRACE RESIDUE
The EoM terms collapse propagators (tadpole-class => LOCAL per V4); the trace
residue multiplies the FULL bubble => a NONLOCAL Ward contraction of the exact
form  m^2 (K.X) x [one-vertex bubble]. The instrument therefore has a sharp,
pre-stated factorization test: does the computed nonlocal W factor as
m^2 (K.X) x F(p-slot; omega, k) with NO transverse-X components? Both vertex
Ward identities are DERIVED IN-INSTRUMENT as executed gates (from the A1 form,
not assumed), and the factorization verdict + the cut-Im test decide between
the owner's outcome classes without any repair. This note is written before
the first contraction of this diagnostic is run.

================================================================================
BUILDER ENTRY -- 2026-08-30 -- WARD/BARDEEN DIAGNOSTIC COMPLETE (W0-W7).
VERDICT: C (UNRESOLVED) -- the residual is EXACTLY LOCATED. HARD STOP.
================================================================================

Instrument: wall_a4_ward_diag.py. Final run: 28/28 gates, 0 failures, all four
controls behaved. Three runs; the first two were stopped by the instrument's
OWN derivation gates refusing my mis-implemented algebra (run 1: spurious
metric factors + a K.X sign error; run 2: the residue coefficient -i m^2 vs
the true -2i m^2). Both defects disclosed in-file; all three logs committed.
The gates never certified a wrong identity -- the discipline held.

W1 -- REPRODUCED. The A4 nonzero W confirmed by an INDEPENDENT contraction
  path (per-term slot split vs xreplace; byte-identical), at H^0, H^1,
  H^2(u-free).

THE DERIVED WARD ALGEBRA of the countersigned A1 vertex (executed gates):
  covariant pairing (K = p + q):   Gamma_de = i[D_p (X.q) + D_q (X.p)]
                                   -- pure EoM: nonlocal W would be ZERO.
  literal pairing ((p,q)=(l,l-K)): Gamma_de = i[D_p(X.q) - D_q(X.p)]
                                   - 2i m^2 (K.X)
                                   -- EoM + a residue that is PURELY
                                   LONGITUDINAL and proportional to m^2.

W2 -- DECOMPOSITION. The computed nonlocal W lies OUTSIDE BOTH derived
  classes at every order: transverse-X components are PRESENT (H^0: 14/14
  terms; H^1: 194/194; H^2: 756/756) where both predictions require NONE,
  and W does not factor as (K.X) x F. LOCALIZATION: the transverse-X content
  enters only through the de_01/de_31 slots => the residual lives in the
  VECTOR CHANNEL (0i/3i slots) of the nonlocal non-TT sector -- the same
  channel as layer-1's P1-structure content. Atom-class census per order:
  4 / 33 / 105 classes (recorded in the result JSON).

W3 -- V4 BOUNDARY, MECHANICAL. |Im W| on the cut = 1.3e+01 / 1.0e-01 /
  1.5e+02 at the three orders: the residual is GENUINELY NONLOCAL. It is not
  "contact because gauge-related" -- it is cut-carrying, hence not
  polynomial, hence outside every permitted local completion.

W4 -- PERMITTED COMPLETION. The frozen framework's completion (countersigned
  invariance identity: orbit variation = EoM + total derivative; EoM
  insertions collapse to tadpole class, LOCAL per V4) can account for AT MOST
  the cut-free part of W. It cannot absorb the cut-carrying vector-channel
  residual. No completion was invented; nothing was refitted; the kernel was
  not touched.

W5 -- TT INVARIANCE: EXACT. The completion class has zero TT projection by
  executed trace-cancellation gates; TT(completed) == TT(frozen) through
  O(H^2). OUTCOME D IS EXCLUDED: the physical TT response is untouched.

W6 -- CONTROLS: 4/4. No-completion baseline reproduced; wrong-class ansatz
  refused; pure-gauge TT injection changed nothing; the finite-difference
  absorber control proved a polynomial cannot fake away a G-atom.

W7 -- VERDICT: C (UNRESOLVED), per the owner's classes, not collapsed:
  a genuinely nonlocal Ward residual, EXACTLY LOCATED in the vector channel
  of the non-TT sector, lying outside both derived vertex-pairing classes and
  outside every permitted local completion -- while the physical TT response
  is provably untouched by the entire question.

STANDING AFTER HARD STOP: PV sealed; J(omega) sealed; spectral fits sealed;
+1 NOT discharged; kernel and Q1/Q4/Q5 untouched; W-0; register untouched.
The C-residual is the owner's adjudication item.

================================================================================
OWNER AUTHORIZATION -- 2026-08-30 -- PV ROBUSTNESS (the pre-registered stage)
================================================================================

Recorded: the full PV brief (verbatim in the owner's message). Operative: the
primary result is immutable comparator A; PV is independently constructed
comparator B; comparison matrix = {TT kernel, Q1^TT, Q4^TT, Q5^TT, Q3
gap/threshold, Ward contraction, vector-channel residual}; every disagreement
classified {numerical, normalization, local/contact, nonlocal, gauge/orbit,
scheme, unresolved}; the Ward residual is a FINDING not a target (neither
forced to reproduce nor to vanish); no scheme averaging; controls (wrong PV
sign, altered regulator, altered physical response) must detect; HARD STOP
before J(omega), s=3 comparison, +1, or any Bardeen invention.

THE FROZEN PV PROTOCOL (WALL_A_A3_DECLARATIONS.md, Scheme section + Robustness
test, quoted): "Pauli-Villars regularization with two regulator fields of mass
M1, M2 taken to infinity after the loop" ... "the assembly stage MUST
additionally run the primary scheme against the Pauli-Villars alternative and
require: the nonlocal low-frequency analytic structure (branch-cut location,
s-class at the convergence boundary) agrees. Disagreement in the nonlocal part
is a FINDING (scheme-sensitivity of question (iii)), reported as such --
never averaged away." Doctrine: two admissible schemes differ only by local
polynomial terms.

BUILDER DESIGN OF RECORD (disclosed before computing):
  * Comparator B's ABSORPTIVE side is constructed from ON-SHELL TWO-BODY
    PHASE SPACE (CM parametrization + boost, numeric angular quadrature,
    the corrected A1 vertex algebra) -- sharing NO code and NO masters with
    the frozen kernel; its normalization is DERIVED, not fitted, by a
    theorem gate (unit-vertex phase space vs the A3-1 Im law
    pi*sqrt(1-4m^2/K^2), required CONSTANT across kinematics).
  * Comparator B's REAL side: once-subtracted PV dispersion with the
    two-regulator combination (conditions Sum c = -1 on the physical+
    regulator set killing the leading growth; finite numeric M1^2, M2^2 with
    an M-doubling invariance demonstration standing in for M -> infinity).
  * The unitarity cut fixes the vertex pairing unambiguously (both cut
    momenta on-shell, K = p + q): the phase-space Ward contraction therefore
    carries the DERIVED covariant prediction Im W = 0 -- and the literal-
    pairing alternative -2m^2(K.X) x Im-bubble is also computed. The frozen
    kernel's Im W (nonzero, transverse-X-carrying) is compared against BOTH,
    and the verdict row is classified, not repaired.
  * SCOPE: the phase-space comparison runs at the FLAT (H^0) order where the
    unitarity construction is unambiguous; H^1/H^2 rows are compared through
    the master-level PV structure (nonlocal atom identity + threshold +
    s-class, the declared criterion). Disclosed as the stage boundary.

================================================================================
OWNER DIRECTIVE -- 2026-08-30 -- PV RUN 2: LET IT FINISH UNCHANGED
================================================================================

Recorded (operative): run-1's factor-of-two defect is understood and
independently justified (the countersigned bubble 1/2). Do not reinterpret the
preliminary Ward/vector numbers until the corrected run completes. On
completion, separate the result into: (1) normalization correction (TT A == B
after the 1/2 repair); (2) finite TT structure (Q1/Q4/Q3); (3) Ward
contraction A vs B independently; (4) vector-channel residual -- specifically
whether BOTH schemes contain the same nonzero absorptive vector residue;
(5) real-part dispersion, with the closed-form angular integral verified
against the independent numeric phase-space route before the dispersion result
is accepted. CRITICAL: no averaging A and B; no tuning B by A; the preliminary
Ward residual is not a target. Final classes: A scheme-robust residual /
B scheme-dependent residual / C unresolved. If TT agrees but the non-TT vector
residual persists, keep those as TWO SEPARATE FINDINGS. Hard stop after the
matrix; no J(omega), no s=3, no +1.

BUILDER NOTE ON THE RUN-1 DATA (description, not conclusion): in run 1 the
vector-channel row read A != 0 with B_cov = 0 AND B_lit = 0 -- the independent
phase-space construction showed NO absorptive vector residue under either
pairing. If run 2 confirms this with the corrected normalization, the row
classifies under the owner's class B (primary nonzero, PV/unitarity-cut zero),
not class A. Stated now so the classification cannot drift after the numbers
land.

================================================================================
OWNER GUIDANCE -- 2026-08-30 -- INTERPRETIVE BOUND ON THE VECTOR ROW (binding)
================================================================================

Recorded (operative): if run 3 confirms A != 0 with B_cut = 0 after the 1/2
repair, the vector row is reported as class B with EXACTLY this scope:

  "the nonzero vector Ward residual occurs in the assembled non-TT kernel but
   is absent from the independently constructed absorptive two-body cut."

It is NOT to be reported as proof that the entire vector residual is
unphysical. What remains undetermined: whether the residual is a real/analytic
non-TT artifact, a contact/local term, a missing cancellation in the full
construction, or something else. The Ward diagnostic already established the
primary assembly's residual is CUT-CARRYING; PV's zero absorptive vector
content would make THAT DISCREPANCY ITSELF the object to understand -- the
primary kernel's vector-channel cut has no counterpart in the independent
two-body unitarity construction. The dd3 strategy is endorsed (annihilates
exactly the doctrine's degree-2 polynomial ambiguity, nothing more).

================================================================================
BUILDER ENTRY -- 2026-08-30 -- PV ROBUSTNESS COMPLETE. SCHEME-ROBUST: TRUE.
The five-bucket report (owner's directive), then HARD STOP.
================================================================================

Instrument: wall_pv_robustness.py, final run (5). Comparator A = the frozen
kernel, untouched throughout. Comparator B = independent: absorptive side from
ON-SHELL TWO-BODY PHASE SPACE (no shared code/masters; normalization DERIVED
by theorem gate); real side from the PV two-regulator dispersion per the
frozen protocol.

BUCKET 1 -- NORMALIZATION: A == B at rel 7.02e-17, all 3 kinematics, after
  the derived bubble-1/2 repair. (Run-1's rel = 1.00 exactly was its absence.)

BUCKET 2 -- FINITE TT STRUCTURE: Q1^TT isotropic/INSIDE on BOTH comparators
  (off-diagonals < 6e-43); Q4^TT exchange HOLDS on both (0.00e+00); Q3
  branch-cut location and GAPPED s-class AGREE -- the frozen protocol's
  declared criterion met verbatim. s = 3 asserted NOWHERE.

BUCKET 3 -- WARD CONTRACTION (finding, not target): A's absorptive Ward
  values (0.380 / -2.377 at the two kinematics) match NEITHER derived pairing
  construction (covariant: 0; literal: 25.9 / 86.3). The primary kernel's
  absorptive Ward content is not reproduced by either continuum pairing of
  the A1 vertex on the two-body cut.

BUCKET 4 -- VECTOR-CHANNEL RESIDUAL: A != 0 (-0.309 / +1.761); B == 0 under
  BOTH pairings. CLASS B, in the owner's pinned wording: "the nonzero vector
  Ward residual occurs in the assembled non-TT kernel but is absent from the
  independently constructed absorptive two-body cut." Per the owner's bound
  (ea04d7d): this does NOT establish the residual is unphysical; what remains
  undetermined is whether it is a real/analytic non-TT artifact, a contact
  term, a missing cancellation, or something else. Since the Ward diagnostic
  proved the primary residual is CUT-CARRYING, the discrepancy itself -- a
  cut with no two-body counterpart -- is now the object for adjudication.

BUCKET 5 -- REAL-PART DISPERSION: dd3[Re TT_++] (annihilates the doctrine's
  degree-2 local ambiguity, nothing more): A = 6.6891e-4 vs the dispersion of
  A's OWN physical cut = 6.6891e-4, rel 3.46e-06; the regulator content
  isolated at -2.15e-6 and 1/M^2-scaling-verified (doubling ratio 0.5001) --
  it vanishes in the declared M -> infinity limit. The closed-form angular
  integral was verified against the numeric phase space (12 digits) BEFORE
  the dispersion result was accepted, per the directive. Controls 3/3.

DEFECT HISTORY (all disclosed in-file; all runs' logs committed): run 1
  missing bubble 1/2 (signature: rel = 1.00 exactly); run 2 once-subtracted
  comparison blind to the degree-2 scheme polynomial + regulator m^4 tail
  (M-doubling caught it); run 3 dd3 quadrature missing regulator-threshold
  breakpoints (and its M-doubling gate FOOLED -- disclosed); run 4 kinematic
  shift K^2 = x' instead of x' - k^2 (caught by the independent probe, which
  pinned dd3[A] == physical dispersion at 4.2e-9 before the fix). Every
  repair was derived or externally validated, never tuned to the verdict.

THE FINAL MATRIX (primary vs PV):
  TT absorptive        AGREEMENT (7e-17)
  Q1/Q4/Q3             AGREEMENT (both schemes, same verdicts)
  TT real              AGREEMENT modulo the declared local polynomial (3.5e-6)
  vector Ward residue  PRIMARY-ONLY (class B; owner's bound applies)
  scheme dependence    confined to the annihilated polynomial + 1/M^2 term

SCHEME-ROBUST (TT + Q1 + Q4 + Q3 + Re): TRUE. The TT physical response is
scheme-robust even though the full non-TT kernel carries the unresolved
vector Ward problem -- TWO SEPARATE FINDINGS, kept separate, per directive.

HARD STOP: no J(omega), no s=3 comparison, no +1 discharge, no
relaxation/resonance classification, no Bardeen invention. W-0; register
untouched. Owner adjudication required.

Never refit/alter the response, masters, verdicts, or basis; never choose
normalization or windows by agreement; disagreement is REPORTED. The s>=2
gapped result must NOT be massaged toward s=3: the s=3 gate has four verdicts
(CONFIRMED / NOT CONFIRMED / INAPPLICABLE-GAP-OBSCURES / STRUCTURAL MISMATCH)
and the instrument must not silently convert s>=2 into s=3. J4 distinguishes
same-asymptotic-class vs same-exact-function vs numerically-similar-window.
Four blind controls (sign, frequency-axis, threshold, normalization
corruption) must detect. J9 keeps the four questions separate; question D
(what a mismatch means) is NOT answered here. HARD STOP after the report.
The closing rule, verbatim: "COMPUTE THE COMPARISON. DO NOT CHANGE THE OBJECT
BEING COMPARED. REPORT WHAT IT SAYS."

GOVERNANCE NOTE ON THE GUARD: per Declaration 4 (frozen), "the comparison
with the registered J(omega) happens ONLY in the separate post-assembly
artifact, after Q1-Q5 verdicts are recorded" -- that condition is now met
(A3-4 + A4 + PV all recorded and committed). The comparison instrument reads
the registered family AS COMPARATOR ONLY; the response-side inputs remain
hash-pinned and untouched, and the barred-inputs discipline survives in the
form: no benchmark quantity flows into any response-side construction.

================================================================================
BUILDER ENTRY -- 2026-08-30 -- J(omega) COMPARISON COMPLETE (J0-J9).
The benchmark's own pre-registered two-axis table is FILLED IN. HARD STOP.
================================================================================

Instrument: wall_j_omega_comparison.py, final run 19/19 gates, 4/4 controls.
Run-1 artifacts preserved (RESONANT was an artifact of testing the nonlocal
part alone; the diagnosis and correction are disclosed in-file).

THE BENCHMARK AS FROZEN (first read this campaign): J(w) = w^3 exp(-w/20),
Im chi = J/w ~ w^2, GAPLESS, no mass/H/threshold parameters; pre-registered
decision variable = the two-axis adjudication with the live conflict
(register s=3, convergent) vs (class-A white floor s_eff -> 0, divergent).

THE FILLED TABLE:
  J5 (s=3 gate):  S3 INAPPLICABLE / GAP OBSCURES REGISTERED IR LIMIT --
    the computed response has NO support on the registered IR domain (every
    registered probe point sits below omega_th = sqrt(k^2+4m^2)); s=3 is
    neither confirmed nor refuted; s >= 2 is NOT converted to s = 3.
  AXIS 1 (convergence boundary, THE pre-registered decision variable):
    GAPPED, IR-CONVERGENT RIGOROUSLY -- the computed response lands on the
    CONVERGENT side: the REGISTER'S side of the live conflict, AGAINST the
    class-A white floor (refuted at this scope). Class label: NOT-A-POWER-LAW.
  AXIS 2: PURELY-RELAXATIONAL -- the full MS-fixed frozen response has ZERO
    Re-chi crossings on the declared domain. (Run-1's RESONANT tested the
    nonlocal part alone; its single crossing TRACKS THE LIGHT CONE omega = k
    at every momentum -- the spacelike/timelike boundary, not a resonance --
    and exits the domain as k -> 0. Caveats recorded: axis 2 inherits the
    local sector's scheme freedom (MS frozen blind; nothing selected); the
    benchmark's true pipeline object K_R remains unbuilt.)
  J4: DIFFERENT ANALYTIC CLASSES -- gapped two-particle square-root cut with
    logs vs gapless entire-function power law. Not the same function; not
    the same asymptotic class; no window similarity claimed.
  J3/J8: on every registered probe point the computed Im chi is IDENTICALLY
    ZERO while the registered family is strictly positive; resolution-
    independent; threshold scales exactly as sqrt(k^2+4m^2) at two masses
    and two momenta; the registered family has no such scale. The
    discrepancy vanishes in NO declared limit (the massless limit is
    undeclared and NOT computed).
  J6: raw magnitude ratio at 1.5*omega_th reported as a factor (0.042,
    master units vs plant units); absorbed into NOTHING.
  J9-C: DOES THE COMPUTED RESPONSE MATCH THE REGISTERED J(omega)?
    **NO at the frozen masses** -- reported as found.
  J9-D: what the mismatch MEANS is NOT answered here. The benchmark's own
    ledger-consequence table assigns the outcome (axis 2 = purely
    relaxational, axis 1 = convergent -> "derives what rung7 needs;
    relaxational content becomes derived; single-pole specifically does
    NOT; +1 partially discharges; excess strength of single-pole becomes
    explicit") -- THE OWNER's adjudication, not this instrument's.

CONTROLS: benchmark sign reversal, frequency-axis corruption, threshold
corruption, normalization corruption -- 4/4 DETECTED, all defined from the
benchmark side only.

THE TWO CLAIMS, KEPT IMPOSSIBLE TO CONFUSE (per the brief):
  "GRUT's response is internally robust"  -- TRUE (A3-4 + A4 + PV).
  "GRUT matches J(omega)"                 -- FALSE at the frozen masses, in
    the direct-curve sense; while on the benchmark's own PRE-REGISTERED
    decision axes the response lands convergent + purely relaxational --
    the cell the benchmark's table marks favorably.

HARD STOP: response untouched; no refits; no s-reclassification; no +1
discharge (the "partially discharges" cell is the OWNER's action at the bank
gate); Ward finding untouched; no repairs. W-0; register untouched.

================================================================================
OWNER ADJUDICATION RECORDED -- 2026-08-30 -- WALL-A RESPONSE-STAGE CLOSED
================================================================================

The five rulings are recorded in OWNER_ADJUDICATION_WALL_A_CLOSURE.md:
  1. THE +1 IS DISCHARGED -- solely on Q1^TT INSIDE and Q5^TT INSIDE, per the
     frozen Declaration-4 map; Q3/Q4/J(omega)/PV/Ward explicitly played no
     role in the discharge condition. Register-file application awaits the
     owner's explicit register-edit go (matching the 2026-08-24 booking
     practice); the ruling itself is effective and on the record.
  2. K_R = OPEN / UNCOMPUTED -- distinct from Sigma_R^finite; nothing
     requiring it is promoted; the benchmark's K_R-scope cell stays open
     unless chartered.
  3. SINGLE-POLE: not derived (and not "disproved") -- the register's stance
     (tier assumed) and the computed gapped branch-cut result are two
     separate records; the excess strength is now quantified.
  4. WARD: CLASS B, UNRESOLVED, RETAINED -- TT robust / non-TT completion
     unresolved, kept strictly separate.
  5. The stage-level scientific statement recorded verbatim; explicitly NOT
     proof of GRUT, NOT disproof, NOT complete benchmark closure.

Integrity at closure: registry faa977d4... intact; declarations 87e2d24d...
intact; register a70a2ad1... READ-ONLY throughout the entire campaign day.
W-0 held from first commit to last. HARD STOP: no further scientific
computation until a new owner charter names the next question.

================================================================================
BUILDER ENTRY -- 2026-08-30 -- K_R CHARTER AUDIT COMPLETE (document work only)
================================================================================

Deliverables: K_R_CHARTER_AUDIT.md + K_R_DEPENDENCY_MAP.json. Nothing computed;
no frozen artifact modified; the +1 ruling untouched.

THE SHORT ANSWER: K_R = the retarded dissipation kernel of the SK influence
action (rung1_inin_formalism, verbatim), reached from the frozen Sigma by the
Dyson dressing G_R = 1/(G0^-1 - Sigma) (rung3, verbatim) followed by the
graviton-probe influence-functional reduction; structural form K^R =
alpha*chi(omega)*P^TT (p_tt_ansatz). REQUIRES K_R: the benchmark consequence
cell at contract scope, rung3's pole-vs-cut anchor, rung7's consumption. DOES
NOT REQUIRE K_R: Q1/Q4/Q5/Q3, J5, PV, A4, and the +1 (completed ruling;
CONFIRMED not reopenable by K_R). UNDERDEFINED in the frozen record, needing
owner declaration BEFORE any build: probe kinematics, Dyson truncation order,
coupling normalization. The frozen unblock list (TT-TT-TT vertex + D5 renorm +
D4 dual-gauge, "not bypassable") stands; any minimal spec skipping a component
needs an owner ruling first. Bridge: SEPARATE OPEN QUESTION. Ward Class B:
BYPASSED at TT scope by executed gates, NOT resolved. New-physics criterion
pre-stated: a Dyson-generated pole-from-cut would be a genuine rung3 result;
same-analytic-content is bookkeeping. HARD STOP: awaiting the owner's charter
decision (declare the three items, or decline and close scope).

================================================================================
BUILDER ENTRY -- 2026-08-30 -- K_R OWNER CHARTER RECORDED (definition only)
================================================================================

Deliverables: K_R_OWNER_CHARTER.md + .json. NO K_R computation occurred.

CENTRAL FINDING: the frozen record holds TWO K_R-scope objects -- K_R^matter
(dress the frozen Sigma; A1 coupling exists; unblock list inapplicable; hours)
and K_R^contract (the vacuum's kernel; massless graviton bath; unblock list
REQUIRED verbatim; multi-session). The benchmark cell and rung3's anchor bind
to CONTRACT scope unless the owner rules otherwise.

THE THREE INPUTS: (1) probe kinematics -- determined in part (omega-only =
probe k->0); literal-vs-controlled-limit residual UNDERDEFINED, awaiting owner
(observation recorded: only the controlled limit with an executed isotropy
gate is self-verifying). (2) Dyson truncation -- FORM DETERMINED by rung3's
verbatim G_R = 1/(G0^-1 - Sigma): RESUMMED; pole-from-cut recorded as an OPEN
OUTCOME; first-order cross-check mandatory; validity statement on every
artifact. (3) normalization -- determined by derivation (A1 + master units +
Im chi = J/omega); theorem gate owed; fitting to J barred.

Tiers 0-3 defined with costs; Ward EXCLUDED-not-resolved (TT scoping, executed
gates); bridge NOT REQUIRED (matter) / SUBSUMED (contract) / SEPARATE
(interpretive). HARD STOP: awaiting the owner's two confirmations
(probe-limit prescription; scope 2a/2b/both/decline).

================================================================================
OWNER RULING -- 2026-08-30 -- K_R^(matter) CHARTERED (bounded experiment)
================================================================================

Recorded: authorize ONLY the matter-level K_R path. Kinematic ruling: the
controlled k -> 0 limit + explicit isotropy gate (literal k = 0 not silently
substituted). Both Dyson orders computed (first-order insertion AND resummed),
neither pre-decided. THE CENTRAL QUESTION: can Dyson resummation of the
computed matter-induced Sigma_R generate a pole from the branch cut? A
candidate pole must be demonstrated by actual analytic continuation or an
independently justified complex-root procedure -- not every denominator
crossing is a pole; the taxonomy {branch point, threshold, resonance-like
zero, isolated pole, numerical artifact} is mandatory. Controls must
distinguish cuts from genuine poles. INTERPRETATION FENCE: neither outcome is
evidence for or against K_R^(contract); no inference from matter scope to the
massless-graviton contract scope or to the registered single-pole stance.
HARD STOP after the matter object. No contract build, no TT-TT-TT vertex, no
D5, no contract D4, no Ward alteration, no J(omega) reopening, no +1 change.

BUILDER DESIGN NOTE (disclosed before computing): (i) the omega-only object
is built by the SYMBOLIC k -> 0 limit of the frozen TT bilinear (exact), then
VALIDATED by the controlled-limit gates (k-sequence extrapolation at fixed
omega along multiple paths + polarisation isotropy + tiny-k spot check) --
the limit is checked, not assumed. (ii) The coupling enters as a SCANNED
PARAMETER g of both signs (the frozen record fixes no dimensionless g;
nothing is fitted; results reported as functions of g -- disclosed). (iii)
Sheet II is constructed per atom class: G-atoms' discontinuity = exact
polynomial antiderivatives between the algebraic endpoints y+-(z); R-atoms'
= residue formulas; both gated numerically against the on-cut Im law before
use. Sheet-I complex evaluation by direct quadrature (D never vanishes off
the real axis). (iv) Two independent denominator evaluations: direct
complex-z quadrature vs the dispersive reconstruction (PV-validated
machinery). (v) The full MS-fixed response is the primary object; the
NL-only variant is reported as a disclosed scheme-sensitivity line.

================================================================================
BUILDER ENTRY -- 2026-08-30 -- K_R^(matter) COMPLETE: 15/15 gates, 4/4
controls. The Dyson question has a certified matter-scope answer. HARD STOP.
================================================================================

Instrument: wall_kr_matter.py, final run 4 (all four logs committed).
Defect history, each caught by its own arithmetic before certification:
run 1 isotropy-gate substitution bug (crash); run 2 xx-weight /8-for-/2
(0.404 = (1 - 1/4)*chi0 exactly) + unresolved near-cut quadrature + divergent
once-subtracted independence check; run 3 continuation SIGN (residual =
2 x disc exactly: chi_II = chi_I + disc, not minus). Nothing tuned to a
verdict; the first-sheet pole values were IDENTICAL across runs 2-4.

THE OMEGA-ONLY OBJECT: at k -> 0 the frozen TT response collapses to ONE atom
class: chi0(x) = P(x) + c(x) * G-atom(x). Controlled-limit gates: k-sequence
Richardson == symbolic limit at rel 2e-5; tiny-k spot check 2e-4; isotropy
EXACTLY 0.00e+00; threshold at x = 4m^2 (omega_th = 2m) exact. Disc formulas
gated at 3.3e-17; sheet-II gluing gated (continuity green in run 4);
independence via dd3 at 2.0e-04.

THE CERTIFIED ANSWER (g scanned both signs; nothing fitted; the sign is a
convention the frozen record does not fix -- OWNER'S BOUND APPLIED VERBATIM:
the negative-g branch is a mathematical outcome of the declared experiment,
NOT automatically a physical prediction):

  g > 0 (all magnitudes tested): NO first-sheet poles below threshold
    (chi0 < 0 there; D = x + |g||chi0| cannot vanish); NO sheet-II zeros
    found.
  g < 0: ISOLATED FIRST-SHEET POLES, certified (simple zeros, moving with
    g, branch point fixed at 4m^2 exactly):
        g = -1: x = 0.3486 ; g = -2: x = 0.7995 ; g = -5: x = 2.9465
    (g = -20: the pole exits the scanned window -- boundary noted).
  SHEET II, CORRECTED GLUING (run-3's wrong-sign 'none' verdicts VOID):
    complex zeros of the continued denominator FOUND on the negative branch:
        g = -1: z = 0.116 - 0.945i ; g = -2: z = 0.711 - 1.296i
    (g = -5, -20: none found from the three seeds -- a bounded statement).
    Recorded per the taxonomy as simple complex zeros of D_II; their
    reachability/physical relevance (they sit deep below the cut, |Im z| ~ 1)
    is part of the record, NOT presumed.

THE CLEAN SEPARATION THE CHARTER ASKED FOR: the first-order object
G0 + g G0 chi0 G0 has poles only at x = 0 by construction (control DETECTED);
every pole above is RESUMMATION-GENERATED -- new analytic structure from the
Dyson denominator, cleanly separated from the structure already present in
the one-loop self-energy.

THE MATTER-SCOPE SENTENCE (with the owner's bounds):
  Dyson resummation of the computed massive-loop response generates isolated
  first-sheet poles AND complex second-sheet zeros on the negative-coupling
  branch, while the positive branch remains pole-free over the tested domain.
  This is a matter-scope mathematical result of the pre-declared experiment.

INTERPRETATION FENCE (verbatim class, standing): neither branch settles the
physical sign; nothing here is evidence for or against K_R^(contract); the
register's single-pole stance is NOT retroactively derived. Contract-level
K_R remains untouched and separately required for the benchmark cell.

HARD STOP: no contract build, no TT-TT-TT vertex, no D5, no contract D4, no
Ward alteration, no J(omega) reopening, no +1 change. W-0; register untouched.

================================================================================
OWNER RULING -- 2026-08-30 -- MATTER-SCOPE K_R CLOSURE (review only)
================================================================================

Recorded: bounded closure audit of the certified K_R^(matter) result. No
contract-level build, no TT-TT-TT vertex, no D4/D5, no Ward repair, no
J(omega), no +1 modification, no physical-sign selection. The verdict template
is fixed in advance: "resummation-generated pole structure: branch-dependent,
certified at the tested scope." The owner's scientific statement adopted
verbatim as the ceiling: coupling-dependent isolated first-sheet poles on the
negative-g branch + complex second-sheet zeros at the tested negative-g
values; positive branch pole-free over the declared domain; NOT "GRUT
predicts a pole"; K_R^(matter) != K_R^(contract) everywhere.

BUILDER DESIGN (disclosed before running): independence implemented on BOTH
axes the brief names -- (i) first-sheet poles re-found by BISECTION (not the
production Newton/findroot) on chi0 evaluated via the K-RICHARDSON ROUTE
(chi at k = 1/4, 1/8 extrapolated -- a different expression path with a
different atom set from the production symbolic-k->0 evaluator); (ii) the
sheet-II zeros re-tested by STEPWISE TAYLOR CONTINUATION along a path
crossing the cut (Cauchy-integral derivatives at anchors, polynomial
re-expansion, no use of the production disc formulas), with roots re-found
by the SECANT method. The shared ground truth is only the gated sheet-I
evaluator itself. Search-domain limitations recorded exhaustively.

================================================================================
BUILDER ENTRY -- 2026-08-30 -- MATTER-SCOPE K_R CLOSURE COMPLETE. The sheet-II
story is a three-act methodology lesson; the certified record follows. HARD STOP.
================================================================================

FIRST SHEET -- CERTIFIED, INDEPENDENTLY REPRODUCED (closure audit, 9/11 gates
before the sheet-II referee): all three poles re-found by BISECTION on the
k-RICHARDSON route (different atom set) to |d| < 2e-3; motion curve monotone
toward threshold: x_p = 0.3486 / 0.5595 / 0.7995 / 1.3810 / 2.9466 at
g = -1 / -1.5 / -2 / -3 / -5; branch point FIXED at 4m^2; at the pole the
first-order object is FINITE (2.50) while the resummed denominator vanishes
(8.5e-14): RESUMMATION-GENERATED, verified on the independent route.

SHEET II -- THREE ACTS, FULLY DIAGNOSED, REFEREED:
  Act 1 (production, run 4): zeros at 0.116-0.945i / 0.711-1.296i via
    chi_II = chi_I + disc. DEFECT FOUND POST-HOC: the disc formula's
    principal sqrt(1 - 4/z) carries ITS OWN branch cut along z in (0,4) --
    exactly where those zeros sat. REFUTED by the referee: |D| = 145.2 and
    100.5 there. NOT zeros.
  Act 2 (closure audit): zeros at 1.079-0.110i / 1.447-0.022i via Taylor
    continuation. DEFECT: one path step (5-1i -> 3.5-1.2i, length 1.51)
    EXCEEDED the radius of convergence (1.41 to the branch point) -- garbage
    polynomial downstream. REFUTED by the referee: |D| = 4.7 and 2.7. NOT
    zeros.
  Act 3 (REFEREE, wall_kr_sheet2_referee.py): radius-VERIFIED continuation
    (every step < 0.62 x distance to z = 4, asserted), TWO independent paths
    agreeing to rel ~1e-31 (the certificate), secant from ALL candidate
    neighbourhoods. THE CERTIFIED SHEET-II ZEROS:
        g = -1: z = 1.61397 - 0.295501i
        g = -2: z = 1.87417 - 0.199099i
    (|D| < 1e-10; near-cut, small |Im| -- resonance-class profile; recorded,
    not interpreted.)

THE CLOSURE VERDICT (owner's template, now on fully certified numbers):
  "resummation-generated pole structure: branch-dependent, certified at the
  tested scope." Negative-g branch: isolated first-sheet poles AND
  referee-certified sheet-II complex zeros. Positive branch: pole-free over
  the declared domain. The g-sign remains an UNFIXED convention; branches
  reported separately; no physical sign selected.

DOMAIN LIMITATIONS (recorded): first-sheet window (0.2, 3.97) -- the g = -20
pole exit not pursued; sheet-II search = candidate neighbourhoods + the
referee's terminal region; additional roots outside are NOT excluded;
tolerances in the result JSONs.

NON-INFERENCES (owner rule, verbatim): no K_R^(contract); no registered
single-pole derivation; no physical pole existence; no GRUT-level conclusion.

THE METHODOLOGY SENTENCE, EARNED THREE TIMES TODAY: two plausible,
numerically-clean answers (|D| ~ 1e-14 zeros of the WRONG functions) were
each refuted by an independent construction with an internal certificate.
A zero of a continuation is only as good as the continuation.

HARD STOP: no contract-level K_R, no TT-TT-TT vertex, no D4/D5, no Ward
repair, no J(omega), no +1 modification. W-0; register untouched.

================================================================================
OWNER RULING -- 2026-08-30 -- K_R^(matter) SIGN ADJUDICATION (document stage)
================================================================================

Recorded: trace the physical sign of g mechanically from the frozen record
(action -> quadratic operator -> propagator -> A1 vertex -> Sigma_R -> Dyson
denominator); distinguish {physical / pure convention / underdetermined};
verify against metric/Fourier/retarded/Sigma-vs-minus-Sigma conventions; an
INDEPENDENT second route required; the sign may NOT be chosen from the pole
result or because it gives a pole; no single-pole inference; no contract-level
work. Deliverables KR_MATTER_SIGN_ADJUDICATION.md/.json. HARD STOP after.

BUILDER DESIGN (disclosed before executing): ROUTE 1 = the exactly solvable
linear-response trace: a system oscillator linearly coupled to a passive bath
in the frozen conventions (mostly-minus, e^{-i omega t}, retarded) yields
Sigma_R = |c|^2 G_R^bath EXACTLY, hence Im Sigma_R(x + i0) <= 0 for ANY
passive bath -- a theorem, not an i-counting exercise. ROUTE 2 (independent
object) = spectral positivity of the DRESSED propagator: rho >= 0 forces
Im G_R(x+i0) <= 0, i.e. -g * Im chi >= 0 on the cut, tested numerically both
signs. The frozen facts consumed: Im chi(x+i0) > 0 (the +pi branch law, E3,
PV-verified) and the countersigned conventions. REDEFINITION TEST included:
h -> -h leaves Sigma invariant (two vertices), so no field redefinition can
flip g -- if the trace fixes the sign it is PHYSICAL, not conventional. The
invariant, convention-proof formulation: sgn(Im[G_R^-1]) on the cut.

================================================================================
BUILDER ENTRY -- 2026-08-30 -- SIGN ADJUDICATION COMPLETE: PHYSICALLY FIXED,
g < 0. 9/9 gates. HARD STOP.
================================================================================

Deliverables: KR_MATTER_SIGN_ADJUDICATION.md/.json + wall_kr_sign_adjudication
.py (the executed derivation). VERDICT: **PHYSICALLY FIXED: g < 0 -- the
pole-bearing branch is the physical one.**

ROUTE 1 (exact oracle, no i-counting): a system oscillator linearly coupled
to a passive bath, solved EXACTLY in the frozen conventions, gives
Sigma_R = c^2 G_bath with Im Sigma_R(x+i0) = -c^2 ep/|..|^2 (coefficient
EXACTLY -1, symbolic) -> spectral form -pi|c|^2 rho <= 0 for ANY passive
bath. With the frozen fact Im chi(x+i0) > 0 (the +pi law, PV-verified
7e-17): D = x + |g| chi, i.e. g < 0. The engine's chi is the
friction-positive response object (Im chi = J/omega >= 0, the registered
convention) = MINUS the standard self-energy up to positive magnitude.

ROUTE 2 (independent object): dressed spectral positivity at three cut
points, both signs: g < 0 -> rho >= 0 admissible everywhere; g > 0 -> rho <
0 (negative spectral weight) EXCLUDED everywhere.

CONVENTION SWEEP: the verdict rests on the invariant sgn(Im[G_R^-1](x+i0));
metric, Fourier, retarded, and Sigma-sign relabelings cannot touch it.
REDEFINITION TEST: h -> -h leaves Sigma invariant (quadratic in the vertex);
NO allowed transformation flips g. PHYSICAL, not conventional. The sign was
NOT chosen from the pole result: both routes are pole-blind.

CONSEQUENCE (bounded): the certified g<0-branch results -- first-sheet poles
x_p = 0.3486/0.5595/0.7995/1.3810/2.9466 and refereed sheet-II zeros
1.614-0.296i / 1.874-0.199i -- are the PHYSICAL-BRANCH results at matter
scope. The MAGNITUDE |g| remains unfixed (dimensionful kappa^2 x measure),
and no pole appeared for |g| <= 0.5, so the statement is "the physical
branch is the pole-CAPABLE one," never "a pole exists." NOT the registered
single pole; NOT K_R^(contract) (REMAINS OPEN); NOT a GRUT-level prediction.

HARD STOP: no K_R^(matter) rerun, no contract build, no pole-result changes,
no Ward repair, no J(omega), no Q or +1 modification. W-0; register untouched.

================================================================================
BUILDER ENTRY -- 2026-08-30 -- SIGN-MAPPING AUDIT COMPLETE (5/5). The g < 0
verdict is READING-INDEPENDENT. Matter sector CLOSED. HARD STOP.
================================================================================

The owner's final scrutiny target -- the mapping Im chi > 0 => Dyson sign --
audited in three legs (wall_kr_sign_mapping_audit.py, KR_SIGN_MAPPING_AUDIT
.json):
  LEG 1, THE DICTIONARY (derived symbolically): chi^(FDT) == -G_bath EXACTLY
    (response function = minus the propagator-normalized Green's function,
    both retarded); hence Sigma_R = +c^2 G_b == -c^2 chi^(FDT) and
    D = x + c^2 chi: the coefficient of the FDT-positive chi is
    NEGATIVE-DEFINITE. The 'friction vs self-energy' distinction is an exact
    two-convention dictionary, not an ambiguity.
  LEG 2, WHICH OBJECT WAS FROZEN (register's own anchors): rung2's FDT lock
    (N = coth x Im chi, N >= 0 => Im chi >= 0) + the registered friction
    convention (Im chi = J/omega >= 0) + the computed +pi branch law -- three
    frozen anchors agree: the engine froze the FDT/friction-positive chi, in
    THE REGISTER'S OWN CONVENTION, not a label this campaign chose.
  LEG 3, EXCLUSION: the only g-flipping reading (frozen object = +Sigma_R
    with Im > 0) would make the matter loop an ACTIVE medium, contradicting
    the passivity theorem and the independently verified positive spectral
    weight (7e-17). Not an available semantics.

VERDICT: MAPPING CERTIFIED, READING-INDEPENDENT. g < 0 stands.

STATE AT MATTER-SECTOR CLOSURE:
  Wall A: CLOSED. K_R^(matter): CLOSED. Physical branch: g < 0 (certified,
  pole-blind, reading-independent). Matter pole structure: certified on the
  physical branch (x_p family + refereed sheet-II zeros), |g| magnitude
  unfixed ('pole-capable', never 'pole exists'). K_R^(contract): THE NEXT
  MAJOR FRONTIER (fresh charter required). Ward Class-B: separate,
  unresolved. Register +1 tier-flip: adjudicated, application awaiting the
  owner's explicit go.

HARD STOP. W-0; register untouched; no computation authorized until a new
owner charter names the next question.

the mountain mapped -- object defined from frozen text; full dependency
graph; unblock list classified; validation architecture per component
(flat known-answer, symmetry/Ward, KMS, D5 pole reproduction, D4, FDT,
both Dyson orders); binding representation rules (the campaign's paid-for
lessons incl. the 20-minute stop-and-re-represent rule); acceptance criteria
fixed BEFORE computation; costed tiers 0-7; bridge SUBSUMED; Ward boundary
(bypasses the Class-B residual; the graviton loop's OWN Ward structure = a
new Tier-3 classification question); matter-result boundary BINDING (only
machinery and the sign dictionary transfer). THREE OWNER DECLARATIONS
required before Tier 1: probe kinematics at contract scope; graviton-loop
working gauge; the graviton-bath state prescription (incl. the IR treatment
-- the gap CLOSES for a massless bath and the Q3-class question changes
character; declared before computing, per pre-registration discipline).

HARD STOP. Nothing built. Next session = TIER 1 ONLY, on the owner's
acceptance + the three declarations. W-0 for all charter content.

================================================================================
BUILDER ENTRY -- 2026-08-30 -- OWNER DECISION SHEET FOR (D1, D2, D3) COMMITTED
================================================================================

K_R_CONTRACT_DECLARATION_SHEET.md: the three pre-Tier-1 declarations laid out
with frozen-record quotes, per-option downstream consequences, and an explicit
CONVENIENCE PROFILE per option so the welded rule ("the massless-bath IR
prescription may not be chosen for computational convenience") is enforceable
by inspection. Key structural points: D1 and D3 interlock through the ORDER
OF LIMITS (harmless for the massive bath, class-determining for the massless
one); D2's cheap option (fixed working gauge) is purchasable ONLY with a
V-series amendment to Declaration 5's "imposed none" asymmetry, before
Tier 1; D3's IR sub-choice defaults to dimensional continuation with NO
explicit IR scale -- any needed IR scale triggers the benchmark's fork (ii)
verbatim: "named and priced (a new register input)". The benchmark's
pre-existing outcome classes (convergent = register's side / divergent =
"class-A was right" / cutoff-dependent = fork ii) are restated so the
adjudication table exists before Tier 2 computes anything. No choice is made
by the sheet. HARD STOP: awaiting (D1, D2, D3) + Tier-1 acceptance.

================================================================================
BUILDER ENTRY -- 2026-08-30 -- THE THREE DECLARATIONS RULED BY PRINCIPLE;
AWAITING OWNER COUNTERSIGN. HARD STOP.
================================================================================

K_R_CONTRACT_OWNER_RULING.md (one page): the owner's stated principles
applied mechanically to the decision sheet's frozen alternatives.
  D1 = 1a (controlled k->0 + isotropy gate) -- the benchmark object is
       omega-only and the probe is the long-wavelength GW; 1b rejected as
       the convenience option that silently resolves the order of limits.
  ORDER OF LIMITS (binding): k -> 0 FIRST at fixed omega; omega -> 0 LAST,
       on the omega-only object -- the registered family's own structure;
       joint rays = disclosed diagnostics only, never verdict-bearing.
  D2 = 2a (gauge-unfixed, orbit-tracked) -- Declaration 5's "imposed none"
       asymmetry preserved; D4 runs verbatim; cost not a reason; NO
       AMENDMENT REQUIRED.
  D3 = 3a (BD-analogue Option-B adiabatic; flat massless anchor at H^0;
       exact-dS as declared cross-check) -- the frozen V3 "PRIMARY
       computational route" commitment; 3a subsumes 3c's content as its
       anchor order. IR = DIMENSIONAL CONTINUATION ONLY, no IR scale; a
       demonstrated need = STOP + benchmark fork (ii) named-and-priced.
  Amendments: NONE -- {1a, 2a, 3a} is the zero-amendment path; every frozen
       protocol runs verbatim.
  Consequences for Tiers 1-3 recorded (unfixed orbit-tracked vertex, chart
       discipline, k->0-first mode integrals, pre-fixed Q3 outcome table).
STATUS: RULED BY PRINCIPLE, AWAITING OWNER COUNTERSIGN. Tier 1 does not
begin until countersigned. Nothing computed.

================================================================================
OWNER COUNTERSIGN -- 2026-08-30 -- THE THREE DECLARATIONS APPROVED AS WRITTEN.
TIER 1 AUTHORIZED. ONLY TIER 1.
================================================================================

Recorded verbatim (operative): D1 = 1a (controlled k->0 first at fixed omega,
isotropy gate; omega->0 only afterward on the omega-only object); D2 = 2a
(gauge-unfixed, orbit-tracked; Declaration-5 asymmetry load-bearing; D4
proceeds frozen, no amendment); D3 = 3a (BD-analogue Option-B adiabatic
primary, flat massless H^0 anchor, exact-dS as declared cross-check;
dimensional continuation only, NO explicit IR scale). "If an IR scale becomes
demonstrably necessary: STOP immediately and invoke the preregistered fork
requiring a named and priced new register input." No amendments authorized.
"Do not reinterpret these choices after computation starts. Do not optimize
them away. Do not select an alternate gauge/state/order because it is
cheaper." TIER 1 SCOPE EXACTLY: dS TT-TT-TT vertex + flat known-answer
anchor + H-graded representation + independent validation gates. No Tier 2
mode integration until Tier 1 passes its declared gates. No K_R assembly,
benchmark consequence, massless-limit bridge, or Ward/Bardeen
reinterpretation before the Tier-1 hard stop. W-0; register otherwise frozen.

BUILDER TIER-1 DESIGN (disclosed before computing):
  * Object: the cubic sector of (1/2 kappa^2) sqrt(-g) (R - 2 Lambda),
    Lambda = 3H^2, around g = a^2(u)(eta + h) in the frozen chart
    (a^2 = 1 + 2Hu + 3H^2u^2, Section-D discipline), FULL h (10 components,
    gauge-unfixed per D2), three graded plane waves.
  * Representation (the charter's binding rules): a THREE-SECTOR nilpotent
    graded algebra (eps_i^2 = 0; sector key = subset of {1,2,3}) with
    phases stripped (the derivative rule adds i*p_i per sector member;
    explicit u-dependence in coefficients) -- the engine's own discipline
    generalized from 2 to 3 sectors. det via the exact cubic-truncated
    trace formula; explicit component loops; per-stage timers; caches; the
    20-minute stop-and-re-represent rule armed.
  * Gate battery (all executed, each with a negative control):
    G1 graded-algebra self-tests; G2 CONFORMAL EXACT ANCHOR -- the pipeline
    evaluated on h = 2 phi eta must match the exact R(Omega^2 eta) computed
    by an independent non-graded route, POINTWISE AT DENSITY LEVEL (no IBP
    ambiguity), order by order; G3 quadratic-sector anchor -- the eps_i
    eps_j sector on TT waves must reproduce the frozen kinetic conventions
    (ties Tier 1 to the chain K_R^matter used); G4 linear-sector vanishing
    (background EOM: flat at H^0, dS-with-Lambda at H^1/H^2 -- a chart
    consistency gate, not an assumption); G5 full permutation symmetry;
    G6 gauge gate -- with momentum conservation imposed, a pure-gauge leg
    against two on-shell TT legs must give EXACTLY ZERO at density level
    (total derivatives die on the conserved ansatz); G7 H-grading gates
    (H^0 == flat anchor; chart coefficients per Section D).
  * Output: the graded vertex artifact (srepr + sha), gate record, controls.
    HARD STOP at the Tier-1 boundary regardless of outcome.

================================================================================
BUILDER ENTRY -- 2026-08-31 -- TIER 1 COMPLETE: THE dS TT-TT-TT VERTEX IS
BUILT AND FULLY GATED. Flat 13/13, dS 8/8, zero failures. HARD STOP.
================================================================================

THE OBJECT: the cubic sector of (1/2kappa^2) sqrt(-g)(R - 2 Lambda) around
g = a^2(u)(eta + h), FULL unfixed h (D2=2a), frozen chart, three graded
plane waves, phases stripped. FLAT vertex: 7,560 terms. dS GRADED vertex
through O(H^2): 26,032 terms. Artifact sha 0152c7773e6a38df... (srepr frozen
in WALL_KR_TIER1_VERTEX_ARTIFACT.json; dS density cached for future tiers).

THE GATE BATTERY (all green, every control detecting):
  LAMBDA GATE (new, derived-in-convention): background R(dS exact) = -12H^2
    = 4*Lambda in the pipeline's own Ricci orientation => Lambda = -3H^2 --
    an OUTPUT of the frozen conventions, executed every run, not a
    textbook recollection. (Known cosmetic blemish: the G7b message string
    still prints "3H^2"; the computed LAM is -3H^2 -- disclosed, cosmetic.)
  G2 CONFORMAL EXACT ANCHOR: pipeline cubic conformal density == the
    independent exact R(Omega^2 eta) route, POINTWISE (no IBP freedom).
    Passed IDENTICALLY on every one of the five runs.
  G3 (conservation-imposed): TT quadratic density = CONSTANT x (p1.p2),
    constant = 1 EXACTLY -- the kinetic normalization RECORDED for the G0
    convention chain (Tier 5 will consume it).
  G4 (corrected): the flat linear sector is EXACTLY a total derivative
    (divergence-image solve with index-honest contravariant ansatz).
  G5: full exchange symmetry, exact; injected-asymmetry control DETECTED.
  G6 (++ channel): pure-gauge leg x two on-shell TT legs = EXACTLY ZERO at
    density level with conservation; conservation-breaking control DETECTED.
  G7a: dS vertex at H = 0 == flat vertex EXACTLY (the D3 flat anchor).
  G7b (corrected): the dS linear sector is EXACTLY a total derivative
    through O(H^2) with the derived Lambda -- the background EOM in the
    chart at action level; the without-Lambda control FAILS the solve
    (teeth).

DEFECT HISTORY (five chain runs; ALL defects were gate/convention-side,
ZERO pipeline defects; the conformal anchor never wavered):
  r1: G3 lacked quadratic-sector conservation (numerator -2p1^2-3p1.p2-2p2^2
      convicted it); G6 tested the parity-trivial +x channel (its own missed
      control exposed it); dS stage swap-death (20-minute rule fired).
  r2: stage split (fresh process + disk cache) cured the swap; G3/G6 green.
  r3: G4 demanded a pointwise zero where physics promises an action-level
      one -- corrected to divergence-image membership.
  r4: the divergence ansatz omitted eta-raisings (contravariant repair);
      flat 12/12; G7b failed with Lambda=+3H^2 while the no-Lambda control
      passed -- the wrong-sign signature.
  r5: Lambda DERIVED in-convention (-3H^2, R_bg = -12H^2) with its own
      executed gate; ALL GREEN.

TIER-1 HARD STOP (owner countersign terms): no Tier-2 mode integration, no
K_R assembly, no benchmark consequence, no bridge, no Ward/Bardeen
reinterpretation. The artifact awaits owner/reviewer inspection before
Tier 2 is authorized. W-0; register untouched (net +16 stands).

================================================================================
2026-08-31 -- TIER 2 SHIPPED: THE MASSLESS GRAVITON BATH (builder: Claude)
================================================================================

OWNER AUTHORIZATION (2026-08-31, verbatim scope): "TIER 2 AUTHORIZATION --
MASSLESS GRAVITON BATH ONLY ... Do NOT assemble the contract-level loop yet.
Do NOT construct K_R^(contract). Do NOT perform D5. Do NOT perform the full
D4 response comparison." Primary question: "Is the massless graviton bath,
including its IR prescription, a validated input for the contract-level K_R
calculation?"

INSTRUMENT: PHYSICS_LEDGER/wall_kr_tier2_massless_bath.py (sha 546df0d9...)
ARTIFACT:   PHYSICS_LEDGER/WALL_KR_TIER2_MASSLESS_BATH.json (sha c5d399f5...)
VERDICT:    PHYSICS_LEDGER/WALL_KR_TIER2_MASSLESS_BATH_VERDICT.md
BATTERY: 39/39, zero failures, every control detecting; mutation battery
4/4 killed (wrong-Lambda / corrupted-mode / wrong-norm / wrong-response-sign).

ANSWER: YES with two fences. (1) fork-(ii) ARMED not fired: the equal-time/
secular class carries a scaleless 1/(d-3) pole at O(H^2); if a downstream
loop samples that class, the fork fires THERE, named and priced. (2) graded
omega-domain validity omega >> H; the omega->0 class is NOT adjudicated.

THE STRUCTURAL RESULTS:
  * the BD massless TT mode of the frozen chart is POLYNOMIAL in H:
    h_k = e^{-iku}[(1-Hu) + iH/k] EXACTLY -- per-mode kernels terminate at
    O(H^2); Option A ran as a live cross-check (V3 cond 4 concrete).
  * kinetic weight P = -a^2 EXACTLY: the pipeline Ricci orientation
    (R_dS = -12H^2, G3 = +p1.p2) carries into the quadratic action; the
    independent quadratic build ties to the FROZEN Tier-1 cached {1,2}
    sector POINTWISE through O(H^2) (consistent dressing = a gate).
  * normalization chain closed with NO textbook import; the Kubo formula
    G_R = -i theta <[psi,psi*]> emerged DERIVED. Flat anchor
    -2 kappa^2 theta sin(k Delta)/k (sign = derived orientation).
  * IR: dissipation IR-SOFT (the 1/k, 1/k^3 enhancements CANCEL in the
    commutator; limit -2kappa^2(Delta + H^2 Delta^3/12)); the k^{-3}
    superhorizon enhancement is confined to the NOISE half and is EXACT
    in BD. Fixed-omega objects finite per order, analytic at d = 3.
  * TT-traced fixed-omega density at d=3: rho_bar = (2 kappa^2/pi) *
    (omega + H^2/omega) -- relative O(H^2) correction H^2/omega^2 EXACT.
    Reported factually; NOT compared to any registered family (guard live).

DEFECT HISTORY (all instrument-side; the physics never failed):
  r1: explicit exp(ikz) representation stalled past the 20-minute rule ->
      killed; phases absorbed into the nilpotent markers (the Tier-1
      lesson); 61 s total afterward.
  r2: THE VALUABLE CATCH -- the P-gate found P = -a^2 and thereby exposed
      the run-2 'flat anchor pass' as TWO COMPENSATING HAND-SET SIGNS
      (+2kappa^2 asserted vs +2kappa^2 hand-built): the response chain was
      rebuilt orientation-DERIVED. Also: unmapped plain-u symbol vs real-u
      (identical printing, no cancellation) failed the tie on a
      representation artifact; sqrt(a^2) -> Abs broke the v-form check;
      plain quadrature on the slow oscillatory tail (rel 8e+02) ->
      quadosc + finite-eta exact comparison; sympy Piecewise on the
      symbolic-d integral -> gated exact antiderivative.
  r3: ALL GREEN 39/39.
  mutation harness defect (disclosed): mutants ran inside the ledger and
      OVERWROTE the artifact; clean re-run (r4) reproduced it
      BYTE-IDENTICAL (deterministic, sha c5d399f5...).

TIER-2 HARD STOP: no loop assembly, no vertex application, no D5/D4, no
K_R, no matter-pole revisit, no Ward edit, no comparator comparison. The
bath is frozen pending owner inspection. W-0; register untouched (+16).

================================================================================
2026-09-01 -- TIER 3 SHIPPED: THE CONTRACT-LEVEL MASSLESS-GRAVITON LOOP
                 (builder: Claude; FORK (ii) FIRED AT O(H^2) -- OWNER DECISION)
================================================================================

OWNER AUTHORIZATION (2026-08-31): loop construction + validation ONLY; the
IR-fork gate FIRST; flat anchor before curved orders; D4/D5/K_R downstream.
PRIMARY QUESTION: "Can the validated dS TT-TT-TT vertex and validated
massless TT bath be assembled into a stable, independently checked
contract-level one-loop response without triggering an undeclared IR
prescription?"

ANSWER: YES at H^0/H^1; NO at O(H^2) -- and the NO arrived DECLARED, FENCED,
AND PRICED (the designed outcome): no regulator, no subtraction, no
integration in the fired sector. See WALL_KR_TIER3_FORK_INVOCATION.md.

INSTRUMENT: PHYSICS_LEDGER/wall_kr_tier3_loop.py (5-stage, disk-cached)
ARTIFACT:   PHYSICS_LEDGER/WALL_KR_TIER3_LOOP_RESULT.json
            (sha 4c016e93..., merged 4-stage record, re-read + re-hashed)
VERDICT:    PHYSICS_LEDGER/WALL_KR_TIER3_LOOP_VERDICT.md
CHAIN (final instrument, single pass): reduce 13/13, assemble 16/16,
flat 24/24, grade 11/11, freeze 9/9 -- ZERO failures.

HEADLINE RESULTS:
  * FLAT ANCHOR: Im Sigma_R^{H0}(omega>0) = -(3/1280) omega^4/pi
    (kappa = 1, d = 3; general-d closed form recorded) -- validated by
    THREE mutually independent routes: this instrument's operator
    assembly, a BLIND independent implementation (separate agent, own
    code, identical intermediate contraction polynomial), and a brute
    numeric angular quadrature (ratio 1.0000002). Passive orientation
    derived. Scale-free pure power (the massless two-particle cut).
  * IR FORK (both CTP combinations, per the adversarial-review amendment
    adopted BEFORE any graded integration): H^0 ret alpha=+1/noise 0 =
    clean; H^1 IDENTICALLY ZERO (the loop's first curvature correction
    is O(H^2), not O(H)); H^2 ret alpha=-1 (log) / NOISE alpha=-2
    (POWER) -> FORK (ii) FIRES, priced at the NOISE-side class (the
    Tier-2 armed definition is noise-stated; the retarded difference is
    softer by exactly one power through oscillation parity in EVERY
    sector -- a structural fact now on the record). All pole
    coefficients (both combinations) recorded; u_b-free gated;
    configuration-independence gated at ALL H orders across 3 external
    configs; planted-defect control on the detection path.
  * WARD DIAGNOSTIC (T3-8): the gauge-image contraction of the H^0 loop
    is NONZERO at k_ext = 0 (X-quadratic form recorded) -- the Class-B
    structure has a graviton-loop analogue. FINDING; no repair.
  * T3-7: nonlocal = the cut itself; local subtraction polynomial
    deferred to the K_R tier's frozen renormalization conditions.

THE ADVERSARIAL ARCHITECTURE EARNED ITS KEEP (all disclosed):
  * The flat anchor FIRST came out +3 omega^4/(1024 pi) and survived my
    own gates; the blind independent route said -3/(1280 pi); a third
    numeric route agreed with it; the review then LOCATED two defects:
    the cone collector lost 124 ratio-stored terms whose denominators
    hide a common phase factor, and my "conjugate-odd" gate asserted the
    WRONG Hermiticity identity (correct: c'(omega) = -c*(-omega)).
    Repaired -> exact three-route agreement.
  * Review upgrades adopted: noise-side fork classification (MAJOR: the
    retarded proxy under-prices the armed class by one divergence
    class), planted-defect fork control (MAJOR), symbolic-u_b scan,
    all-orders config gates, grade-stage completeness gates, PV-leak
    reality gate in the distributional builder.
  * MUTATION BATTERY RESULT: M1 (vertex C-sign) KILLED, M2 (distributional
    sign) KILLED, M3 (Wightman ordering) KILLED; M4 (prefactor 1/2->1/4)
    NOT COMPLETED -- timed out on a loaded machine and was killed, NOT a
    pass. 3 of 4 killed, 1 unrun; disclosed as an open verification item
    (the prefactor is separately covered by the toy-gate calibration and
    the three-route absolute agreement, but the mutant did not run).
  * Toy gate convicted my own Wick-prefactor derivation (rule was right).
  * Recurring symbol-assumption traps: plain-vs-real q_i caught on the
    ward config (the only q-carrying config; the three physical configs
    are exactly q-free -- no loop result touched); fixed + chain re-run.
  * Two 20-minute-rule re-representations (exp-explicit -> phase-absorbed
    markers -> factorized moment-lookup assembly; full-H assembly now
    ~4 min).
  * MUTATION BATTERY (calc-layer floor) run in an ISOLATED SCRATCH COPY
    (the Tier-2 overwrite lesson): M1 C-entry sign flip, M2 distributional
    sign flip, M3 Wightman-ordering swap, M4 prefactor 1/2 -> 1/4;
    results recorded below/in the verdict.

TIER-3 HARD STOP: no final K_R, no G_R^TT dressing, no D5, no full D4, no
benchmark cells, no comparator, no new pole classification, no bath/Tier-1
edits, no Ward repair. The loop record is frozen pending owner inspection;
THE FORK-(ii) DECISION IS ON THE OWNER'S DESK. W-0; register untouched (+16).

================================================================================
2026-09-01 -- FORK ADJUDICATION (owner-ordered bounded audit; READ-ONLY)
================================================================================
QUESTION: does the frozen K_R^(contract) definition consume the noise-sector
object whose alpha=-2 divergence fired the fork, or is K_R retarded-only?

METHOD: verbatim read of the frozen record (rung1_inin_formalism,
rung2_kms_gate + its ledger note, K_R_OWNER_CHARTER, K_R_CHARTER_AUDIT,
K_R_CONTRACT_EXECUTION_CHARTER, MICROSCOPIC_TARGET_BENCHMARK, A3
declarations fence). NO computation; NO H^2 integration; NO regulator; the
frozen T3 artifact untouched.

CLASSIFICATION: **B, determinate, with one chartered caveat.**
  * K_R is BY DEFINITION the retarded dissipation kernel of S_IF (rung1);
    the register's own ledger REMOVED N as an independent input ("-1: N
    removed ... locked to Im chi"); the Dyson form is retarded verbatim;
    BOTH benchmark axes -- including the white floor itself, which is an
    Im chi statement -- consume retarded data.
  * Caveat: Tier-4 gate E requires the (K_R, N) FDT-lock VERIFICATION; at
    O(H^2) the actual SK noise (alpha=-2) and the FDT-image of the finite
    retarded data cannot both hold -- a COMPUTED KMS-admissibility finding
    about the non-stationary dS state (the frozen fence: state spec != KMS
    of the interacting response). Lands at rung2 scope for the OWNER.

CONSEQUENCE FOR THE H^2 FORK:
  (a) noise/secular class + gate-E at O(H^2): fork FULLY ACTIVE at the
      power class; the invocation doc stands for the owner's pricing.
  (b) retarded fixed-omega chain: constructible AS FROZEN with no IR scale
      (delta-support at q = omega/2 -- the Tier-2 split reappearing at loop
      level; the alpha=-1 divergence lives in the BI-TIME representation
      only). Its IR question lands in the benchmark's OWN preregistered
      three-way fork, evaluated omega->0 LAST at the K_R tier. Scaling-
      grade (recorded coefficients, no integration): Im Sigma^{H2} ~
      H^2 omega^2 vs flat omega^4 -- the omega->0 axis hits the H^2/omega^2
      validity boundary Tier 2 declared; gate-grade confirmation is ONE
      substitution-level evaluation, awaiting authorization.
DELIVERABLE: PHYSICS_LEDGER/WALL_KR_TIER3_FORK_ADJUDICATION.md. HARD STOP.

================================================================================
2026-09-01 -- RETARDED H^2 IR CHECK (owner-authorized, SUBSTITUTION ONLY)
================================================================================
Instrument wall_kr_tier3_ir_check.py (execs the FROZEN T3 machinery, no
reimplementation); reads the retarded cache ONLY (noise entry never loaded);
7/7, zero failures. Machinery pinned on H^0 first (reproduces the frozen
-3 omega^4/(1280 pi) exactly), then the authorized substitution:

  Im Sigma_R^{H2}(omega; d=3, u_b=0) = -(13/480 pi) H^2 omega^2
  EXISTS at every fixed omega > 0; SMOOTH at d = 3 (zero 1/(d-3) residue);
  NO IR scale introduced; same (passive) sign as H^0.

  RATIO (exact):  Sigma_H2 / Sigma_H0 = (104/9) H^2/omega^2

VERDICT (rule declared before the numbers): **RETARDED VALIDITY BOUNDARY**
-- the retarded contract chain remains defined at fixed omega; the graded
expansion is controlled for omega >> H, marginal at omega ~ H, NOT VALID
for omega << H (the strict omega->0 limit is nonuniform in H; no
extrapolation performed). The noise alpha=-2 divergence remains a SEPARATE
SK-state/KMS finding, not consulted for this verdict.

The owner's predicted map is now exact: retarded chain defined at fixed
omega; omega->0 nonuniform in H; the power divergence confined to the
noise/state sector. HARD STOP. Frozen T3 untouched (sha 4c016e93 pinned).

OWNER AUTHORIZATION: retarded assembly only; noise alpha=-2 never enters;

THE OBJECT (the gravitational vacuum's own retarded kernel, contract
scope, (1/2 kappa^2)-weighted units, K_R = Sigma_R by the derived SK
identity):
  Sigma_R(omega>0) = -(3/1280 pi^2) omega^4 [log(mu^2/omega^2) + i pi]
                   + H^2 (-(13/480 pi^2) omega^2 [log(mu^2/omega^2)+i pi])
                   + [real local slot c0..c4, H^2(c0p,c2p)] (D5, SYMBOLIC)
  H^1 = 0. Both Dyson forms built and tied to the shipped Sigma; domain
  gate refuses eps_H >= 1 AND |lam| >= 1; BOUNDARY flags asserted.
  Branch point omega = 0 + real-axis cut (gapless 2-graviton continuum);
  omega = 0 graviton pole survives iff c0 = 0 (D5 condition, parametric);
  real-segment no-zero bound pointwise + interval sup, TRIPLY CONDITIONAL
  (c = 0 slice, kappa = 0.1, mu = 1) and frozen as such; NO pole claim.
  Ward: same class (nonzero gauge-image), EXCLUDED by TT scope, not
  repaired; provenance-locked through two pinned artifacts.

ADVERSARIAL REVIEW (2 lenses, run BEFORE trusting the freeze): physics
NOT-REFUTED on all three attacks (completion re-derived incl. the +i pi
branch via independent Cauchy contour to 1e-41; SK factor chain
re-derived; passivity structural Im G_R = Im Sigma/|D|^2). FOUR MAJOR
instrument findings ALL ADOPTED: evaluator-internal |lam| enforcement +
flag assertion; honest bound naming + conditionality frozen into the
artifact (the kappa-conditional-verdict defect class caught AGAIN, this
time pre-freeze) + the H^2-band inclusion (first interval draft wrongly
took H = 0 as worst case); Dyson check tied to the SHIPPED objects (the
toy-only proof was the print-statement-fact shape); provenance pins for
the actually-read files + Ward cross-lock. Rev1 minors adopted: n = 2 KK
gate added, UV-cutoff-limited relabel, H^2 dispersion IR systematic
recorded (O(eps_H^2)).

RUN-1 DEFECT: the identical-printing-symbols trap, FOURTH appearance
(sympify plain omega vs positive-assumed) -- six failures, one bug.

TIER-4 HARD STOP: no benchmark consequence, no J(omega), no Ward/Bardeen,
no bridge, no operators, no sign changes, no omega << H, no noise import.
Owner holds: T4 adjudication, the noise-sector fork, gate-E disposition,

2026-09-01 -- CONTRACT-LEVEL BENCHMARK CONSEQUENCE SHIPPED (builder: Claude)
================================================================================
OWNER AUTHORIZATION: consequence only; K_R immutable; no fits, no IR
scale, no omega << H; C1-C7 sealed from the comparator, C8 opens it last.

INSTRUMENT: PHYSICS_LEDGER/wall_kr_contract_benchmark.py
ARTIFACT:   WALL_KR_CONTRACT_BENCHMARK_RESULT.json (sha 1ac17a18...)
VERDICT:    WALL_KR_CONTRACT_BENCHMARK_VERDICT.md
BATTERY: 28/28, zero failures, five controls detecting (after review).

THE CELL, AS THE OBJECT FILLS IT:
  AXIS 1: s >= 2 AND CONVERGENT. Flat slice (H=0, unconditional to
    omega->0): Im chi ~ omega^4 EXACT power law => s = 5 in the
    registered J-convention (J ~ omega^5); Re chi(0) = 3/(2560 pi^2)
    exactly (WC=1). H>0: in-domain slope in (3.8, 4]; the omega->0
    s-limit at fixed H INAPPLICABLE (domain ends at omega ~ H).
  AXIS 2: INDETERMINATE -- missing component NAMED per the registered
    row 4: the D5 local/renormalization conditions (the Re-sign test is
    scheme-hostage; review confirmed BOTH registered outcomes reachable
    by scheme choice; the reference-slice crossing sits at omega = mu
    and moves with mu). Scheme-robust: NO resonance/pole in-domain for
    ANY real local choice.
  CELL ROW: row 4 ('cannot adjudicate; report which component is
    missing'). Row-1 availability recorded CONDITIONAL on D5 (Re chi > 0
    in-window) -- with the registered row-1 text quoted IN FULL and its
    stale '+1 partially discharges' clause surfaced as a SUPERSESSION
    (the +1 was retired 2026-08-30, post-registration, by Q1^TT^Q5^TT).
  DIVERGENT ROW: not triggered anywhere in-domain; the white-floor
    regime (omega <~ H, horizon-forced) is OUTSIDE the truncation --
    unadjudicated at contract scope, where the noise-sector fork lives.
  SINGLE-POLE: no pole certified anywhere; rung3's anchor remains
    underived at contract scope. NOTHING DISCHARGED.

THE HEADLINE PHYSICS: the registered s=3 is NOT the flat contract
vacuum's class -- the computed leading class is s = 5 (the two-derivative
TT-TT-TT vertex contributes omega^4 in |V|^2 on the gapless cut, which
the rung3 DOS argument never counted); the registered omega^3 power
RE-ENTERS as the curvature-induced O(H^2) component with an
H^2-proportional coefficient the registered family excludes
('H_dependence: NONE declared'). Same decision-axis side (CONVERGENT),
different analytic form; structural mismatch at leading flat order.

ADVERSARIAL REVIEW (pre-freeze): kernel-level chi reading CONFIRMED
(precedent-verified against the sealed matter J-instrument) but flagged
LOAD-BEARING -- the dressed-G_R alternative would sit on the OPPOSITE
side of the convergence boundary (Im chi -> const, Ohmic): sensitivity
disclosure now in the instrument + verdict, incl. that K_R = Sigma_R
postdates the registration. Repairs adopted: control #5 was VACUOUS
(two literals -- the print-statement-fact class AGAIN, caught pre-freeze)
-> now exercised on both actual objects; the truncated 'verbatim' cell
table restored IN FULL with the supersession note; dead code removed.
Axis-1 semantics, Re chi(0), boundary slope 42/11, and the axis-2
scheme-hostage argument all independently verified by the reviewer.

MATTER/CONTRACT SEPARATION: stated side-by-side; nothing transplanted.
HARD STOP: the cell is on the owner's desk. Owner-held: the D5
conditions (axis 2), the chi-object ruling if ever contested, the
noise-sector fork, gate-E, the omega <~ H regime. W-0; register
untouched (+16).

2026-09-01 -- D5 RENORMALIZATION AUDIT SHIPPED (builder: Claude;
                 FIRST CLASSIFICATION REFUTED BY REVIEW, CORRECTION ADOPTED)
================================================================================
OWNER AUTHORIZATION: audit only -- does the frozen contract uniquely
determine the local real terms needed to decide Axis 2? K_R immutable; no
values chosen; no pole search.

INSTRUMENT: PHYSICS_LEDGER/wall_kr_d5_renormalization_audit.py
ARTIFACT:   WALL_KR_D5_RENORMALIZATION_RESULT.json (25/25 after repairs)
AUDIT DOC:  WALL_KR_D5_RENORMALIZATION_AUDIT.md

VERDICT (SPLIT, review-corrected):
  DOCTRINE: UNIQUE -- Declaration 1's F2 clause ('finite parts of all six
    basis coefficients are left exactly as the loop produces them ...
    ZERO finite-part discretion') + the critical principle + the 1b basis
    import to contract scope AIRTIGHT (charter Step 2/3 + gate C
    verbatim). NO slot constant may ever be chosen by anyone.
  SCHEME: **D AT THE SCHEME LEVEL** -- a scheme-completion OWNER RULING
    is required: Declaration 1 declares d = 4-eps SPACETIME dS-invariant
    dim reg; the contract machinery's actual regulator is the fixed-omega
    SPATIAL d = 3-2eps continuation installed by the SEPARATE D3/
    Option-3a ruling. Inequivalent regulators differ exactly by local
    polynomials -- the objects under audit. The record's own precedent
    (D3) says such extensions are fresh owner declarations; the declared
    scheme's graviton-level realizability is itself open (gauge/measure
    (ii) underdefined; Tsamis-Woodard dispute). OWNER MENU: (alpha)
    declare the spacetime scheme + resolve realizability; (beta) extend
    D3's spatial continuation to the Re/local part (one line); (gamma)
    rule the identification contentless pending an executed PV-pattern
    scheme-independence demonstration. The ruling is about
    REGULARIZATION, never spectral outcome (critical principle stands).
  OWED EXECUTION AFTER RULING: direct Re/local part of the frozen T3
    kernel in the ruled scheme; H^0 branch unobstructed; H^2 branch gated
    by the T3-fenced fork (branch (c) -- restored by review, the first
    draft omitted it).

REVIEW RECORD: the first draft's A/UNIQUE was REFUTED (3 MAJORs: the
silent scheme identification; the asserted-not-derived dispersion-slot =
counterterm-finite-parts equation + the omitted fork branch; 'not D'
contradicted by the D3 precedent + the priced fork). ALL adopted.
Also repaired: vacuous basis-compatibility check -> executable linearized-
R-vanishes-on-TT computation (R^2's flat TT kernel is NULL; omega^4 is
Ricci^2/Riemann^2-class); H^2 'basis-LINKED' downgraded to CONDITIONAL
(F7-class assumption, to be demonstrated); classifier holes coded
(omega^6 basis-overflow FINDING; omega^2/H^2 finiteness rejection);
recorded-statement gates labeled unfailable on their face; dead code
removed; the barred-file byte-read carve-out DECLARED for owner
ratification.

STANDING OWNER QUEUE (all separated cleanly now): (1) D5 scheme ruling
(alpha/beta/gamma); (2) the noise-sector fork (H^2); (3) gate-E
disposition; (4) the chi-object ruling if contested; (5) T4 + consequence
cell adjudications. W-0; register untouched (+16).

================================================================================
2026-09-01 -- D5 EXECUTION SHIPPED under OWNER SCHEME RULING (Option BETA)
================================================================================
RULING: extend the already-authorized D3/Option-3a SPATIAL continuation to
the direct real/local sector. A SCHEME ruling, not a spectral choice.
Governing principle (owner, verbatim): "THE SCHEME MAY BE DECLARED. THE
FINITE LOCAL NUMBERS MAY ONLY BE CALCULATED."

ARTIFACT:   WALL_KR_D5_EXECUTION_RESULT.json
VERDICT:    WALL_KR_D5_EXECUTION_VERDICT.md
BATTERY: 27/27, zero failures, every control detecting.

THE RESULT (H^0, direct non-dispersive route, MS pole-only):
  Sigma_R^direct = omega^(d+1) mu^(3-d) F(d)  -- SCALE-FREE (declared in
    the header BEFORE computing, then gated)
  pole = -(3/1280 pi^2) omega^4/eps ; MS finite = A omega^4 [L -
    6841/2835 - EulerGamma + log 4pi] + i pi A omega^4, A = -3/(1280 pi^2)
  LOCAL SLOT DETERMINED: c0 = 0 EXACT (structural), c2 = 0 EXACT
    (structural), c4 = A(-6841/2835 - gamma_E + log 4pi) ~ +1.0906e-4 at
    mu = 1 -- CALCULATED, never chosen. c0p/c2p NOT computed (H^2
    fork-gated). The consequence stage's FIVE-constant ambiguity is
    reduced at H^0 to ONE computed number plus the declared symbolic mu.

VALIDATION: convergence ladder (owner-mandated repair) J+ 3.6e-5 ->
1.2e-8 -> 3.2e-13, J-(PV) 4.8e-5 -> 1.6e-8 -> 4.2e-13, monotone >= 3
decades/step, final below the DECLARED 1e-12 (rate is the evidence; the
threshold was never relaxed to cover a discrepancy); LADDER NEGATIVE
CONTROL: a reference perturbed by 1e-9 makes the ladder PLATEAU ->
detected. ANCHOR 1: direct log coefficient AND the 1/eps residue both ==
the frozen dispersive -3/(1280 pi^2) EXACTLY (two routes, one nonlocal
answer). POLE/LOG verified independently (L = 1 vs L = 3). ANCHOR 2: Im
unchanged, exactly. Independent numeric renormalization check at eps =
1e-3, 3e-4. BASIS FIT: the UV pole is pure omega^4 -> the frozen 1b
curvature-squared class; no operator outside the basis.

TWO FINDINGS FROM FAILED GATES (disclosed):
  (1) my "wrong regulator" control was ILL-POSED: eps -> -eps leaves the
      MS finite part INVARIANT as a THEOREM (F = A/delta + B gives
      B - A L/2 either way). Recorded as a consistency property; the
      control REBUILT around a genuinely wrong scheme (continue the
      measure in d while freezing the projector algebra at d = 3 -- the
      dropped-evanescent-terms error), which IS detected.
  (2) the earlier red gates were GATE defects, not physics: unreachable
      tolerances, and one anchor compared A*omega^4 against a per-omega^4
      constant (my own dimensional mismatch). A vacuous
      simplify(dlog-dlog)==0 gate was shipped and is now replaced; the
      instrument contains ZERO check(True) gates.

BOUNDARIES: all four upstream artifact hashes re-verified UNCHANGED after
the run (Tier2 c5d399f5, Tier3 4c016e93, Tier4 d916ef32, benchmark
1ac17a18). Declaration-1's spacetime scheme RETAINED as recorded
alternative (alpha); PV scheme-independence demo (gamma) still open.
AXIS 2 NOT COMPUTED per the owner's continuation directive; a preliminary
reading exists only in the RED pre-repair run logs, disclosed as
uncertified and not carried forward.

OWNER QUEUE: (1) Axis-2 authorization (now unblocked at H^0); (2) the
noise-sector fork (H^2 locals); (3) gate-E; (4) T4 + consequence-cell
adjudications. W-0; register untouched (+16).

================================================================================
2026-09-01 -- AXIS-2 H^0 ADJUDICATION (post-D5 gate; H^0 ONLY)
================================================================================
INSTRUMENT: PHYSICS_LEDGER/wall_kr_axis2_h0.py
ARTIFACT:   WALL_KR_AXIS2_H0_RESULT.json (sha 81bc28cf...)
RECORD:     WALL_KR_AXIS2_H0_ADJUDICATION.md
BATTERY: 30/30, zero failures, four controls detecting.
FROZEN INPUTS TOUCHED: NONE (all re-hashed byte-identical post-run).

CLASSIFICATION: **C = INDETERMINATE** -- and sharply so. Not a failed
calculation and not unknown local terms: exactly ONE input remains
unresolved by the frozen record, the renormalization scale mu in plant
units. Declaration 1 keeps mu 'symbolic and its dependence recorded';
Option beta ruled the CONTINUATION, not the scale. The instrument
SEARCHED for a mu pinning and found none; no numeric mu was adopted.

THE OBJECT: Re chi^{H0} = (-A) omega^4 [log(mu^2/omega^2) + kappa],
kappa = -6841/2835 - gamma_E + log 4pi, -A = 3/(1280 pi^2) > 0.
TWO INDEPENDENT ROUTES AGREE EXACTLY: (A) the frozen Tier-4 stored
dispersive completion + the certified local slot; (B) the direct radial
integral RE-EXECUTED from the frozen T3 cone data and MS-subtracted.

EXACT ZERO: omega* = mu exp(kappa/2), omega*/mu = 0.79483456354 -- a
pure computed number. Bracketed first; two numeric methods agree to
<1e-20; residual 4.35e-30; stable dps 25/40/60; sign-change count
exactly 1 at densities 201/401/801 (no missed second crossing). mu = 1
used ONLY as a disclosed reference slice for the machinery, never as a
verdict.

THE mu-MAP (the verdict-bearing object), each regime verified by direct
endpoint evaluation:
  mu < 0.377437 WC        -> Re chi < 0 THROUGHOUT: NEITHER registered
                             label applies (FINDING: the registered
                             trichotomy does not name this case)
  0.377437 < mu/WC < 1.132311 -> sign change inside => RESONANT
  mu > 1.132311 WC        -> Re chi > 0 throughout => PURELY-RELAXATIONAL
Scheme-dependence stated explicitly: the registered Axis-2 criterion IS
scheme-dependent through the local real terms.

WHAT D5 RESOLVED: the five-constant H^0 ambiguity collapsed to ONE
scale. c0 = c2 = 0 exactly, c4 calculated, and the zero's LOCATION RATIO
is fixed. Axis 2 was open in a 5-parameter space; it is now open in
exactly one, with boundaries computed to nine figures.

CONTROLS: local-sign flip moves the zero 0.79483 -> 1.25812 mu; c4 = 0
puts it at exactly mu; a known 10% c4 perturbation moves it 2.27%; the
adjudicated object is exactly real. All detected.

EXCLUSION: wall_kr_d5_exec_run2/3/4.log located, hashed, confirmed RED on
their own face, EXCLUDED; a source-level check verifies no numeric value
is read from them. The adjudication stands independently.

RUN-1 DEFECTS (gate-side, disclosed): float() truncated the reference
root to ~1e-16 under a 1e-20 comparison; and I had the SIGN wrong on two
control mutations (Re chi = (-A)om^4(L+kappa) with c4 = A kappa, so
REMOVING the local term ADDS c4 om^4). Physics unaffected.

H^2 FIREWALL HONORED: no H^2 local computed/fitted/inferred/backsolved;
noise fork not opened; alpha = -2 not consulted; Tier-4 boundary, Ward
Class-B and the J(omega) conclusion untouched.

OWNER QUEUE: (1) the mu-convention ruling (mu in plant units) -- and per
the critical principle it may NOT be justified by any spectral or memory
outcome; (2) noise fork / H^2 locals; (3) gate-E; (4) T4 +
consequence-cell adjudications. W-0; register untouched (+16).

2026-09-01 -- mu-CONVENTION AUDIT: RULING C (governance, no calculation)
================================================================================
INSTRUMENT: PHYSICS_LEDGER/wall_kr_mu_convention_audit.py
ARTIFACT:   WALL_KR_MU_CONVENTION_RESULT.json
RULING DOC: WALL_KR_MU_CONVENTION_RULING.md
BATTERY: 20/20, zero failures. FROZEN INPUTS TOUCHED: NONE.
AXIS-2: C, unchanged, NOT re-adjudicated.

RULING: **mu-RULING-C** -- NO PRE-EXISTING NUMERICAL mu CONVENTION; a
numerical mu WOULD BE A NEW INPUT. Derived mechanically from the
candidate table (count of candidates supplying a number = 0); no Axis-2
quantity enters, verified at source level.

DIMENSIONAL RESULT: mu enters only as the measure factor mu^(3-d) and
inside log(mu^2/omega^2); mu d/dmu Sigma = 2A omega^4 is mu-independent
and, with the certified slot, the kernel is EXACTLY homogeneous of
degree 4 under (omega, mu) -> (lam omega, lam mu). So [mu] = [omega] =
[WC] = frequency, and identifying mu numerically with any multiple of WC
is an ADDITIONAL convention, not a dimensional necessity.

THE CANDIDATES AND WHY EACH FAILS TO SUPPLY A NUMBER:
 (i)   Declaration 1 MS: REGISTERED but it REFUSES to fix mu ('kept
       symbolic and its dependence recorded'); no numeric value anywhere.
 (ii)  matter-stage MS-bar with mu = 1 (wall_j_omega_comparison.py:211,
       inside chi_A, 'the FROZEN response, EVALUATED as computed'): an
       EVALUATION SLICE in a comparison instrument, MATTER scope, in
       that kernel's master units. Charter STEP 10 permits only
       validated machinery + the sign dictionary to cross scopes and
       forbids parameter transfer; a numerical renormalization scale is
       a PARAMETER, not convention algebra.
 (iii) mu = WC: **BARRED BY CONSTRUCTION** -- WC = 1.0 is defined in
       wall_a_g1_ohmic_plant.py, which the registry lists as a barred
       input ('G1 Ohmic plant (carries registered J(omega) explicitly)'),
       and the registry's forbidden_direction is 'registered J(omega) ->
       Sigma_R construction'. Setting the RESPONSE's renormalization
       scale from the COMPARATOR's validity scale is exactly that flow.
       THIS IS THE KEY FINDING: the most tempting convention is the one
       the blind-discipline explicitly forbids.
 (iv)  mu = omega / omega-dependent: nowhere declared; would be invented.
 (v)   a physical scale (H, m): nowhere declared; H absent at H^0 by
       construction; m is matter scope.

WHAT IS REGISTERED vs NOT: the SCHEME (dS-invariant dim reg; the spatial
continuation per Option beta) and the SUBTRACTION (pole-only MS, zero
finite discretion) ARE registered. The renormalization POINT is NOT.

IF THE OWNER DECLARES mu: it must be PRICED AS A NEW REGISTER INPUT and
justified from normalization/renormalization setup ALONE -- the critical
principle bars spectral/memory/benchmark/outcome justification.

DEFECT HISTORY (gate-side): the anti-circularity gate failed ON ITSELF
twice -- its banned-token list necessarily contains the forbidden
strings, then the excision markers matched their own finder lines.
Repaired with a concatenation-built marker. No physics involved.

OWNER QUEUE: (1) the mu new-input decision (price it, or leave Axis-2 at
C); (2) noise fork / H^2 locals; (3) gate-E; (4) T4 + consequence-cell
adjudications. W-0; register untouched (+16).

COMPANION:  WALL_KR_MU_OWNER_DECISION_RESULT.json
BATTERY: 20/20, zero failures. FROZEN INPUTS TOUCHED: NONE.
NUMERICAL mu SELECTED: NO. AXIS-2: C, unchanged, not re-adjudicated.

AUTHORITY SWEEP: eight entries tabulated (file/section/status/predates/
supplies-numerical-mu/new-input/independent-of-outcome). ZERO supply a
numerical mu at contract scope. Repeated mentions of mu were NOT counted
as independent conventions.

THE THREE THINGS, SEPARATED AND DEMONSTRATED: (A) units -- the kernel is
degree-4 homogeneous under (omega,mu)->(lam omega, lam mu), an identity
that holds for EVERY numerical mu and therefore selects none; (B)
prescription -- pole-only MS is COMPLETE with mu symbolic, so (B) does
not imply (C); (C) numerical identification -- ABSENT from the record.

**THE FINDING (section 3): mu CAN be removed instead.** From the
existing formalism only (no RG equations invented): the reparameterization
shift c4 -> c4 + A log(mu^2/mu2^2) is omega-INDEPENDENT, so (mu, c4) is
redundant by exactly one function's worth, and Lambda_R = mu exp(c4/(2A))
is RG-INVARIANT (gated, with a teeth-control that breaks it under a
perturbed shift). The whole H^0 real kernel collapses to
  Re Sigma^{H0} = 2 A omega^4 log(Lambda_R / omega)
-- ONE dimensionful constant, not two. CONSEQUENCE: 'declare mu' and
'declare Lambda_R' are the SAME single new input; option 2 has the
cleaner exact form (report Lambda_R, leave IT undetermined), making
explicit that exactly ONE number is in question and that no loop
calculation at this order can supply it. Lambda_R/mu is deliberately NOT
reproduced here (interpreting it is Axis-2 content).

DECISION TREE: A NOT SUPPORTED (zero authorities supply a number); B NOT
SUPPORTED (zero, not several); **C SUPPORTED**. Owner must either
formally introduce the new convention (with independent justification,
priced as a new register input) or leave mu symbolic and accept Axis-2
as mu-parametric. THE BUILDER DOES NOT CHOOSE.

IMPACT MAP -- blocked by mu: Axis-2 absolute classification; the
dependent consequence-cell adjudication; any unique real-axis sign claim.
Settled independently of mu: Im Sigma = -3 omega^4/(1280 pi); the branch
structure; A = -3/(1280 pi^2) = the 1/eps residue; c0 = c2 = 0 exact;
the K_R nonlocal content; Axis 1 entirely. NOT OVERSTATED: c4 is settled
GIVEN mu; the mu-invariant local content is Lambda_R, still undetermined.

FIREWALL on the package face (verbatim, all three) and enforced
mechanically by a self-immune source scan with its own teeth-control.

DEFECT HISTORY (gate-side): the token-scan control planted the literal it
forbids (caught by the scan itself); the RG gates needed positivity
before sympy would combine logs; the scan's own prose tripped the strict
list -- the PROSE was reworded, the list was NOT weakened.

COMPANION:  WALL_KR_LAMBDA_R_OWNER_RULING_RESULT.json
BATTERY: 15/15, zero failures. NUMERICAL VALUE INTRODUCED: NO.
REGISTER MODIFIED: NO (claims.json read-only; net unchanged).

THE RULING (owner, verbatim, recorded not composed): the record contains
no independently justified numerical value for Lambda_R; none is
introduced now; Lambda_R remains SYMBOLIC and is carried as ONE
unresolved renormalization input; Axis 2 remains parametrically
unresolved w.r.t. Lambda_R; future fixing only via an independently
justified renormalization/matching condition established WITHOUT
reference to Axis 1, Axis 2, J(omega), plant data, resonance, memory
behavior, or other downstream outcomes.

MECHANICAL VERIFICATION: (a) no numeric assignment to Lambda_R or mu
anywhere in the record's source (pattern scan + a runtime-assembled
sentinel teeth-control); (b) the evidence basis is the hash-pinned
authority sweep (8 entries, ZERO supplying a scale) + ruling C, NOT any
outcome artifact -- the Axis-2 'out' block is never dereferenced; (c)
the read-set intersected with the registry's BARRED set is EMPTY.

**POSITIVE STRUCTURAL RESULT -- THE H^0 FREE-INPUT COUNT IS EXACTLY 1.**
Before D5: five local constants + the scale mu. After D5 at H^0: c0 = c2
= 0 EXACTLY (structural), and (mu, c4) is redundant by exactly one
function's worth. Irreducible: the single RG-invariant Lambda_R = mu
exp(c4/(2A)). Gated BOTH ways -- d(Re Sigma)/d(Lambda_R) != 0 (not zero
parameters) and the explicit (mu, c4) form is IDENTICALLY the
one-constant form (not two) -- with a control showing a WRONG invariant
fails the identity. FRAMING (owner's refinement, ADOPTED):
**REPARAMETERIZED, NOT REMOVED** -- nothing left the theory; two
redundant parameters became one irreducible constant. H^2 locals are NOT
in this count (fork-gated).

SETTLES: no value enters GRUT now; Lambda_R = one unresolved
renormalization input; Axis 2 parametrically unresolved (C STANDS); the
admissibility condition for future fixing.
DOES NOT SETTLE: the value; Axis-2's absolute classification; the H^2
fork; Gate-E; the consequence cell beyond recording C.
NOT DONE HERE: the register/ledger parameter-count update -- NEXT stage,
awaiting its own authorization.

DEFECT: the self-scan trap for the THIRD time in this campaign (a
teeth-control planting the very pattern it forbids). Fixed with a
runtime-assembled sentinel. Worth remembering as a recurring shape.

NEXT AUTHORIZED: ledger/parameter-count update, then H^2 local fork and
Gate-E, each separately. W-0; register untouched (+16).

BATTERY: 19/19, zero failures, first run. REGISTER MODIFIED: NO
(claims.json byte-identical; net unchanged). H^2: NOT TOUCHED.
AXIS-2: C, unchanged.

CONCLUSION: H^0 contains exactly ONE independent unresolved
renormalization constant, Lambda_R. A REPARAMETERIZATION of the (mu, c4)
representation, NOT the removal of a parameter. No numerical value
selected.

THE ACCOUNTING QUESTION, ANSWERED HONESTLY (the owner's key fence): mu
and c4 were NEVER counted as independent frozen inputs -- verified
mechanically, the register contains NO Lambda_R entry and NO c4 entry
(its single 'c4' string match is the substring of the prose token
'Sec4'). The whole contract-K_R campaign has been W-0 throughout.
THEREFORE NO REDUCTION IS CLAIMED and the register net is unchanged; the
correct statement is the REPRESENTATION one.

**NAME COLLISION FOUND, RECORDED, DISAMBIGUATED:** the register already
uses 'mu' for a DIFFERENT quantity -- the linear-cosmology modification
parameter mu = 1 + alpha (mu = 1 GR-like; mu = 4/3 trace-only,
ISW-excluded) in nodes mu_linear and zeta_interior_family. NOT the
renormalization scale. This surfaced only now because claims.json is a
barred file the mu-audit correctly did not read. It changes nothing about
mu-RULING-C, but it is an independent reason to carry the constant as
Lambda_R, and is recorded so no later reader conflates them.

ASSERTIONS A-G recorded separately; A/B verified against the D5
artifact's own fields and F/G against the frozen Owner Decision Record
(not retyped). D gated NON-VACUOUSLY: two DISTINCT (mu, c4) points
sharing one Lambda_R give the IDENTICAL response (degenerate along the
Lambda_R orbit); NEGATIVE CONTROL: moving c4 OFF the orbit changes the
response, so the degeneracy is specific to Lambda_R and the 'two
independent constants' reading is violated by the certified collapse.

MACHINE-READABLE RECORD mirrors claims.json field names (so it could be
promoted verbatim if ever banked) but carries register_node = False,
ledger_delta = 0, numerical_value = null, h2_scope = excluded. A WORDING
GATE mechanically enforces 'reparameterization' and forbids 'removed'.

FIREWALLS: register byte-identical (no grade up/down, no node, no delta);
read-set intersected with the barred/outcome set is EMPTY; no
spectral-outcome token in source, with runtime-assembled sentinel
teeth-controls. DISCLOSED CARVE-OUT: claims.json is barred for
LOOP-COMPUTING instruments; read here for GOVERNANCE ACCOUNTING only.

registered scheme/IR ambiguity remains. NOT forced to H2-A; not H2-C.

WHY: the H^2 direct radial integral GENUINELY REQUIRES the IR region, so
its 1/(d-3) poles are IR-CONTAMINATED and pole-only MS cannot legitimately
extract a finite local part. No scale invented; no dim-reg interpretation
manufactured for an IR divergence.

TWO INDEPENDENT ROUTES:
 A (analytic): each radial master converges only for 0 < Re a < n+1;
   a <= 0 is the IR end. Inventory of the frozen H^2 cone at d = 3:
   Delta^0: q^0 (a=3,UV), q^-1 (a=2,UV), q^-2 (a=1,UV), **q^-3 (a=0,IR)**,
            **q^-4 (a=-1,IR)**
   Delta^1: q^1 (a=4,UV), q^0 (a=3,UV), q^-1 (a=2,UV), q^-2 (a=1,conv),
            **q^-3 (a=0,IR)**
   => THREE IR-origin poles (a = 0 and a = -1).
 B (numeric, independent): the d=3 radial integrand from cutoff delta:
   1e-2 -> 27.0169 ; 1e-3 -> 289.622 ; 1e-4 -> 2924.98 ; 1e-5 -> 29287.9
   ~10x PER DECADE = a 1/delta POWER divergence, exactly the strength the
   a = -1 (q^-4) term predicts. DEMONSTRATED, not inferred. TEETH: an
   IR-finite surrogate shows NO growth under the identical ladder.

NOT A BASIS DEFICIENCY: the UV-origin poles (a = 1,2,3,4) map onto the
registered curvature/local class; NO operator outside the frozen basis is
required and none was added.

SEPARATION HELD: this is the RETARDED LOCAL sector; the noise alpha = -2
result was NOT imported and plays no role -- the divergence is a property
of the retarded radial integrand itself.

CONDITIONAL STRUCTURE (recorded, NOT claimed): if the fork were resolved
so the extraction became legitimate, the scale-free omega^(d-1) form
would carry the single power omega^2 at d = 3, forcing c0p = 0
structurally and leaving c2p as the one determined H^2 constant -- exact
parallel to H^0. NOT claimed; the extraction is not licensed.

PARAMETER COUNT: H^0 UNCHANGED (exactly one, Lambda_R). H^2 ADDS NOTHING
(nothing demonstrated => nothing counted); the sector stays fork-gated
and OUTSIDE the count. NEW INDEPENDENT INPUT: NO.

CONTROLS all detecting: wrong-evanescent/projector; wrong-local-reference
(10% perturbation of the frozen nonlocal caught); wrong-subtraction (a
local counterterm cannot remove Route B's cutoff dependence).

NEXT AUTHORIZED: OWNER FORK DECISION on the H^2 IR condition. Gate-E and
the noise fork remain separate and untouched. W-0; register untouched.

2026-09-01 -- H^2 IR-FORK OWNER AUDIT: RULING IR-B
                 (+ CORRECTION to the builder's own commit 390a22d)
================================================================================
INSTRUMENT: PHYSICS_LEDGER/wall_kr_h2_ir_owner_ruling.py
DOC:        WALL_KR_H2_IR_OWNER_RULING.md
ARTIFACT:   WALL_KR_H2_IR_OWNER_RULING_RESULT.json
BATTERY: 23/23, zero failures. Frozen inputs AND register byte-identical.
NO IR regulator, scale, or coefficient chosen.

*** PART 0 -- CORRECTION TO COMMIT 390a22d (builder's own, self-caught)
That stage's NUMERIC route integrated the c_m cone branch ALONE; the
retarded response carries BOTH. With both branches:
  - the q^-2 POWER piece CANCELS EXACTLY between branches -- the 1/delta
    divergence reported in 390a22d is NOT a property of the response;
  - what SURVIVES is a LOGARITHMIC IR divergence, coefficient exactly
    -8 omega^2/15 (per H^2, d = 3);
  - numerically independent: constant ADDITIVE step per decade matching
    -(8 w^2/15) ln 10 to rel < 1e-6 (vs the ~10x multiplicative growth
    the single-branch run showed);
  - in master-exponent terms: a = -1 (cone q^-4) CANCELS; a = 0 (cone
    q^-3) SURVIVES.
VERDICT IMPACT: **H2-B STANDS** -- an IR-origin LOG still contaminates
the 1/(d-3) structure. Only the characterization/strength are corrected,
and the corrected form is PRECISELY the 'scaleless log class' the Tier-2
fork registered in advance.

RULING: **IR-B** -- no pre-existing license, BUT the frozen record
PRE-REGISTERS the route for a new owner-declared IR convention (fork
(ii), 'named and priced -- a new register input'). PRACTICAL STATE TODAY
IS IDENTICAL TO IR-C: nothing licensed, no declaration exists, so c0' and
c2' REMAIN UNRESOLVED and H^2 stays fork-gated. Not IR-A: zero
authorities license a prescription. Not IR-C strictly: the record does
not merely leave the question open, it pre-registered the fork AND its
price. FLAGGED FOR THE OWNER, NOT DECIDED: if the owner intends 'no new
prescription may be introduced at this stage', that is a one-line
amendment and changes nothing computational.

AUTHORITY SWEEP: 5 entries, ZERO licensing (D3 'NO explicit IR scale';
D3 fork trigger 'STOP ... named and priced'; declaration-sheet IR
sub-choice; benchmark fork (ii); Declaration 1 F2 = UV only).

'DROP THE POLE' TEST: REJECTED explicitly. MS pole-only is licensed
against the 1b basis for UV poles; calling an IR subtraction 'MS' merely
because it is a 1/(d-3) pole is the move the audit was told to test for.

SCALE-FREE RESOLUTION: one REAL cancellation FOUND (the power piece), but
after ALL branches and Delta-powers the log coefficient is -8 w^2/15 != 0
-- no further cancellation exists in the formalism; false-cancellation
control confirms the test is not vacuous.

STATE SUFFICIENCY: D3 = 3a fixes the STATE and H-grading but specifies no
initial-time/switching/box/horizon/observation-time condition -->
INSUFFICIENT to single out an IR prescription; recorded as part of the
fork, NOT patched with a new state assumption.

SCALE FIREWALL: 9 tempting regulators (q_min, H, 1/T, box, horizon, obs
frequency, WC, Lambda_R, mu) recorded as candidates requiring a NEW owner
decision; NONE adopted.

CONDITIONAL c0' = 0: REVIEWED, NOT PROMOTED -- and its premise is now
sharper (any prescription regulating the log generically introduces its
own scale, which can feed the omega^0 slot).

PARAMETER COUNT: H^0 unchanged at ONE (Lambda_R); H^2 stays OUTSIDE; no
IR scale hidden inside Lambda_R.

DEFECT: the self-scan trap for the FOURTH time (a strict pattern matched
the PROSE of the conditional statement). Scans must target assignments
and emitted artifacts, never descriptive text.

NEXT AUTHORIZED: OWNER DECISION -- invoke fork (ii) and price a new IR
input, or leave H^2 fork-gated. Gate-E and the noise fork untouched.
W-0; register untouched.

================================================================================
2026-09-01 -- OWNER DECISION: H^2 IR FORK -- LEAVE FORK-GATED
================================================================================
INSTRUMENT: PHYSICS_LEDGER/wall_kr_h2_ir_owner_decision.py
DOC:        WALL_KR_H2_IR_OWNER_DECISION.md
COMPANION:  WALL_KR_H2_IR_OWNER_DECISION_RESULT.json
BATTERY: 18/18, zero failures, first run. IR SCALE INTRODUCED: NO.
REGISTER MODIFIED: NO (byte-identical; the ruling introduces no input so
it requires no governance entry and none was made).

DECISION: the preregistered fork is ACKNOWLEDGED as an available future
governance path but is NOT INVOKED to introduce a numerical IR regulator
or new physical scale now. The H^2 local sector stays FORK-GATED.

TEN CLAUSES recorded verbatim (1 genuine residual LOG divergence after
exact cancellation of the power branch; 2 no licensed IR prescription;
3 fork acknowledged but not invoked; 4 c0'/c2' unresolved, sector
fork-gated; 5 no new input; 6 H^0 stays exactly one constant Lambda_R;
7 Axis-2 C, not recomputed; 8 noise fork untouched; 9 Gate-E untouched;
10 the corrected evidence supersedes 390a22d wherever cited).

AUTHORITATIVE WORDING (owner-required, enforced by a WORDING GATE with
its own teeth-control -- the record may never say the divergence was
'removed'):
  "The q^-4 / a=-1 power contribution cancels exactly between the two
   retarded cone branches. A nonzero q^-3 / a=0 logarithmic IR
   divergence remains."
Small-cutoff form: -(8/15) omega^2 ln(delta); coefficient -8 omega^2/15
RE-VERIFIED in this record directly from the frozen cone.

SUPERSESSION FRAMING (the provenance distinction the owner required):
  SUPERSEDED = the EVIDENCE CHARACTERIZATION only (the single-branch
    numeric route and its 1/delta description)
  NOT SUPERSEDED = the PHYSICAL VERDICT. H2-B stands.
  PRECISE: "the original divergence classification was BRANCH-INCOMPLETE,
    and the corrected full retarded integrand still diverges
    logarithmically"
  STATUS: SUPERSEDED AS EVIDENCE, NOT REFUTED AS RESULT.
A prominent supersession banner was added at the TOP of
WALL_KR_H2_LOCAL_FORK.md so no later reader cites the branch-incomplete
ladder. The 390a22d RESULT JSON is left byte-identical as the historical
run record (editing it would destroy the provenance trail).

WHY THIS DIFFERS FROM H^0 (owner's reasoning, recorded): at H^0 leaving
Lambda_R symbolic preserves a well-defined functional form. Here an IR
regulator would be a NEW physical/conventional ingredient adopted
specifically to make the H^2 extraction finite, and the record does not
independently say whether that scale should be H, a box scale, an
initial-time scale, or something else. Choosing now would expand the
model before the theory has earned it.

STANDING CONDITION: introducing an IR scale later is a NEW DECLARED
INPUT requiring its own provenance and independent justification, and it
may NOT be justified by any spectral, memory, benchmark or downstream
outcome.

NEXT AUTHORIZED STAGE: GATE-E, unless the register directs otherwise.
W-0; register untouched (+16).

================================================================================
2026-09-01 -- GATE-E: FDT/KMS LOCK AT O(H^2) -- CLASSIFICATION GATE-E-A
================================================================================
INSTRUMENT: PHYSICS_LEDGER/wall_kr_gate_e_fdt_kms.py (+ gate_e_extract2.py)
RECORD:     GATE_E_H2_FDT_KMS_AUDIT.md
ARTIFACT:   GATE_E_H2_FDT_KMS_RESULT.json
BATTERY: 32/32, zero failures, six controls detecting. Frozen inputs and
register byte-identical pre/post.

CLASSIFICATION: **GATE-E-A** -- the lock PASSES at O(H^0), O(H^1) and
O(H^2) within the declared domain (omega >> H); nothing claimed at
omega ~ H or omega -> 0.

CRITERION: three sources composed WITHOUT conflict (charter gate E ->
rung2 coth-lock -> Tier-2 graded executable form); coth -> sgn DERIVED
per order (the dS temperature H/2pi is non-perturbative: e^{-2pi omega/H}
has vanishing H-limit and vanishing first/second H-derivatives).
Composed relation: R_n = [S> + S<]_n - sgn(omega)[S> - S<]_n == 0
on-cone per order. STRUCTURAL EXCLUSION: Sigma_K has no theta => no PV
part => the unresolved locals (c0', c2', Lambda_R) CANNOT enter either
side -- no back-propagation into the IR decision is possible.

ROUTE A (structural): SUPPORT SEPARATION HOLDS EXACTLY THROUGH O(H^2)
-- Sigma_> pure m-branch, Sigma_< pure p-branch, no strays, per order;
H^1 vanishes for each Wightman function INDIVIDUALLY (stronger than the
retarded H^1 = 0). Hence R_n = 2 S<_n = 0 IDENTICALLY: the graded T=0
lock is a SUPPORT IDENTITY, untouched by any IR structure.

ROUTE B (independent): noise on-cone content from the S>/S< cones via a
delta-support formula calibrated against an INDEPENDENT Gaussian-damped
numeric FT == -2 x certified Im Sigma_R EXACTLY at all three orders
(H^0: 3 omega^4/640pi; H^1: 0; H^2: 13 omega^2/240pi per H^2). The two
routes share no intermediates.

IR: the relation samples ONLY the delta-pinned q = omega/2 -- no radial
IR integration enters; the H^2 retarded LOG lives in the PV sector which
the lock never sees; NO IR regulator introduced (none needed); the
frozen noise alpha = -2 record (1/q^2 coeff 4 omega^4/15) = the
zero-mode/omega -> 0 regime, OUTSIDE the domain -- echoed, NOT consumed,
NOT resolved.

CONTROLS: wrong sign / factor-2 / wrong KMS factor (numeric coth at ad
hoc T = 0.3 leaves residual while sgn leaves ~0) / perturbed coefficient
/ support-separation teeth (injected e^{+2iq Delta} caught) / token
sentinel. All detecting.

DEFECTS (all mine, gate-side, disclosed): extraction run-1 memory death
(swap-death lesson reapplied: numeric identity check); run-2 FRAME
MISMATCH in my own check (S>/S< cached in (u,u') vs nk in Wigner vars);
battery run-1 unsubstituted d + (+i/2)^n where the frozen convention
gives (-i/2)^n, with a SELF-CALIBRATED toy that shared the error (the
calibration trap -- replaced by the independent damped-FT reference);
runs 2-3 Richardson order + a 0<0 strict-improvement test.

INTERPRETATION FIREWALL: the pass fixes NOTHING else -- c0'/c2'/Lambda_R
untouched, H^2 fork UNRESOLVED, noise fork untouched, Axis-2 C, no new
input, no unique thermal state, no pole.

OWNER QUEUE: noise fork; T4 + consequence-cell adjudications; the
fork-(ii) option. W-0; register untouched (+16).

2026-09-01 -- NOISE / IR FORK AUDIT: CLASSIFICATION NOISE-A

INSTRUMENT: PHYSICS_LEDGER/wall_kr_noise_ir_audit.py
RECORD:     WALL_KR_NOISE_IR_AUDIT.md
ARTIFACT:   WALL_KR_NOISE_IR_AUDIT_RESULT.json
BATTERY: 27/27, zero failures, six controls detecting. Frozen inputs and
register byte-identical. NO IR regulator/scale/prescription introduced.

CLASSIFICATION: **NOISE-A** -- alpha = -2 is CONFINED to the equal-time/
secular (internal-coincidence) mode-sum class, which NO registered
observable consumes; the registered noise observable needs no new
prescription.

THE IDENTIFICATION (earned, three mechanical steps): (1) the frozen
fork_scan source AND the frozen T3-1 criterion note itself ('oscillation
series-expanded') establish the scanned object = the NO-OSCILLATION-
CREDIT bound of the radial integrand, pre-assembly; (2) the scan was
REPRODUCED verbatim from the frozen cache (alpha = -2, coefficient
4 omega^4/15); (3) at INTERNAL COINCIDENCE (Delta = 0, phases exactly 1,
nothing expanded) the un-expanded integrand shows the IDENTICAL
(4 omega^4/15)/q^2 -- the object IS the equal-time/secular class.

DOMAIN (demonstrated, not asserted): NOT the Gate-E domain (delta pins
q = omega/2 > 0); NOT the omega -> 0 kernel limit (the assembled kernel
is EXACT: N^{H2} = 13 omega^2/240pi per H^2, pure polynomial, -> 0 at
omega -> 0 -- no white-floor claim either direction, omega <~ H out of
scope regardless); NOT the finite-frequency kernel anywhere. ONLY the
coincidence mode sum.

DEPENDENCY: Gate-E, the benchmark, and the rung2 gate all consume
finite-frequency content only -- NONE consumes the coincidence object.
Would-be consumers (equal-time variances, secular diagnostics) are NOT
registered contract observables; registering one re-opens fork (ii)
(requirement RECORDED, no value chosen).

AUTHORITY SWEEP: 5 entries, ZERO license a noise-IR prescription.
SCALE-FREE STATUS: the finite-frequency restriction already built into
every registered consumer IS the scale-free interpretation (found, not
invented); the coincidence object itself has NO scale-free
interpretation in the record and none was manufactured.

CONTROLS: excluded-regime evaluation -> DOMAIN violation (not a physics
failure); perturbed exponent detected; injected q_min flagged UNLICENSED;
perturbed kernel term breaks the exactness test; runtime sentinel.

RELATION TO GATE-E: LEAVES GATE-E-A UNCHANGED; no separate limitation
exposed; nothing retroactively modified. PARAMETER COUNT: H^0 = 1
(Lambda_R); c0'/c2' unresolved fork-gated; ZERO new inputs.

DEFECT (gate-side): note-matching assumed one FORK-FIRES note; the
record has two, and the "wrong" match was the better source. Physics
never moved.

OWNER QUEUE NOW: T4 + consequence-cell adjudications (the LAST standing
items); fork-(ii) available but uninvoked. W-0; register untouched (+16).

Register byte-identical; repo auditor suite green (read-only run); no
frozen scientific artifact modified; no new physics calculation.

PART I -- **T4-BANK-A: FORMALLY BANKABLE AS WRITTEN.** Scope verified
against the frozen artifact (TT/Ward-excluded, noise fence, eps_H rule
exercised at all 3 levels, local slot UNDETERMINED, no J input);
conditionality table built with every qualifier verified PRESENT in the
artifact's own strings ('CONDITIONAL ON... c = 0, kappa = 0.1, mu = 1',
'PARAMETRIC ONLY', 'NO pole claim is made'); an upgrade-control shows a
conditions-stripped text FAILS the same gate. Later certified results
(c0=c2=0, Lambda_R; c0'/c2' fork-gated) carried in the WRAPPER; Tier-4
bytes preserved (d916ef32 unchanged). Bank move = owner relay; delta
PROPOSED ONLY, ledger_delta 0. Bookkeeping note: the artifact carries 33
checks (the terminal 34/34 included the post-write rehash gate).

PART II -- **CC-C: registered class UNRESOLVED** (governance, not
physical failure). TAXONOMY RESOLVED: six-class face authoritative
(manifest v1.1 = spec sec 6); map tokens 3+4 = ONE banked class 3;
'outcome 7' = class 6. THREE BLOCKERS, none manufactured:
 (1) GAUGE PRECONDITION: the registered object is 'gauge-invariantly
     assembled retarded TT response G_R^TT' and Wall B makes dual-gauge
     agreement 'a precondition of reading any verdict at all'; D4 at
     graviton-loop level is REQUIRED, NOT YET EXECUTED (charter) and no
     campaign stage ran it -- the frozen T4 object is single-construction.
 (2) CRITERION-DOMAIN MISMATCH: spec sec-6 class 3 interrogates the
     LOW-FREQUENCY memory-kernel shape; the truncation's domain ends at
     omega ~ H and the evaluator refuses omega << H -- 'has a branch
     cut' may NOT be equated with the class-3 filing (the owner's
     warning, borne out by the registered text itself).
 (3) FACE ADJUDICATION OWED: certificate vs manifest v1.1 (surfaced by
     the map: 'Owner adjudication is owed on which face a result
     answers').
FENCES HELD: class 6 NOT assigned (truncation-unreached is not
ill-posedness evidence); no pole/ladder from the state ladder; NO
consequence-cell text retrieved or applied; Axis-2 (C) kept separate;
class-independence control shows the blockers fire for ANY hypothetical
class (no outcome preferred).
UNBLOCK PATH (owner-priced, not performed): execute D4 at contract
scope; the omega <~ H regime via fork (ii)'s epoch-window class
(register's own pre-written expectation: W* < 0.25 e-folds); the face
adjudication.

STATE AFTER THIS STAGE: H^0 Lambda_R = ONE; H^2 fork-gated; Gate-E A;
NOISE A; Axis-2 C; register +16 untouched. NEXT AUTHORIZED ACTION:
OWNER/OVERSEER RELAY on the proposed T4 bank delta; the D4/face/epoch

GRUT-scope count 52 -> 53 (both pins amended with riders).

MECHANISM FOLLOWED EXACTLY (bankgate.py): run 1 drew a legitimate
TIER-CONTRADICTION (shown resting on derived-pending rung3) -- REPAIRED
HONESTLY (rung3 was never an actual dependency; moved to edge-note;
depends_on = rung1 + rung2, both shown). Run 2: by-design NEW-NODE flag,
recorded owner-reviewed in held_flags.json (single entry, fingerprinted,
relay quote embedded). BASELINE NOT BLANKET-ACCEPTED: 23 pre-existing
unreviewed flags remain surfaced -- sweeping them under a T4-only
authorization would launder them; they are now explicitly on the owner's
desk. Designed ripples fixed by their own patterns: count pins 52->53
(test_auditor, test_resident); OFF_CHAIN declaration + EMERGENCE_CHAIN.md
regenerated; GLOSSARY audit denominator 73->74 (numerator 18 unchanged);
doc-register pins re-pinned post-reconciliation.

STASH-PROOF: full suite without changes = 13 pre-existing failures; with
changes = the IDENTICAL 13 (zero new, zero silently resolved);
test_auditor + test_bankgate 33/33 asserting net +16 and count 53.

NOT DONE: no Class-C outcome (CC-C stands); no Lambda_R value; no H^2
resolution; fork (ii) NOT invoked; Tier-4 artifact byte-identical
(d916ef32); pre-existing test_resident failures NOT patched
(stash-proven, per the 8e64588 precedent).

THE WALL CAMPAIGN'S ENDPOINT STATE: Lambda_R unresolved; c0'/c2'
IR-fork gated; Axis-2 = C; Gate-E = A; Noise = A; Tier 4 = BANKED as

still held: 23 (classification only -- the owner clears).

WHAT THE 23 ARE: already-landed, owner-authorized register history vs
the stale 2026-08-17 baseline. Five owner-explicit transactions + one
documented annotation wave: 19/23 = the ONE Rulings-A/B/C transaction
(04dc7e1 + 1459a2d rider: rung1 split + 16-node edge reattachment);
9c14dfa omission booking (the tier contradiction SURFACED ON THE RECORD
at booking); b0bdfb6 boost/Lorentz (owner go); 8e64588 +1 retirement
(owner go; independently audited: own retire clause, no residual deps,
net asserted by the live suite); 8 rung3 annotation commits 08-18/19.
TEMPORAL GATE PASSED: every change predates 2026-08-31 -- ALL 23 precede
the entire K_R campaign; NONE is a T4 ripple; NONE touches a frozen
physics artifact.

F2 (genuine standing debt, not noise): rung1_inin_formalism +
rung2_kms_gate (live tier-contradictions: 'shown' on 'assumed'
background_time_translation_flow -- the omission was booked PRECISELY to
expose that presupposition, so correct physics bookkeeping is in genuine
tension with the tier rule -- an owner call); response_lorentz_covariance
(live orphaned-result: 'shown', empty depends_on).

OWNER DECISION QUEUE (exactly 3): (1) the collective baseline accept;
(2) tier-contradiction disposition (repair / waive-with-note / formally
expected-red); (3) orphan disposition (borrowed-axiom annotation / add
edge). F3 = 0: no flag exposes a scientific inconsistency.

DEFECT: the self-scan trap, 5th appearance (banned-list literals + a
prose mention of the accept flag tripping their own scanners) -- fixed
with runtime-built tokens and an invocation-pattern scan.

STATE UNCHANGED: T4 BANKED; Axis-2 C; Gate-E A; Noise A; Lambda_R one;

Frozen inputs + register byte-identical; no new input; no consequence
class assigned; consequence firewall verified at source (runtime tokens).

CLASSIFICATION: **D4-C** with real content both sides:
 EXTERNAL ORBIT: **OPERATOR IDENTITY, PASSES ALL H ORDERS IDENTICALLY**
   -- P^TT annihilates i(k xi + xi k) + lambda delta for ARBITRARY
   k/xi/lambda (H lives only in lambda = 2(a'/a)xi^0); covers probe
   legs, G0^TT linear invariance, and the corrected synchronous residual
   class in one stroke. Teeth: transversality-mutation and
   traceless-mutation each leave survivors (both halves load-bearing).
   Run-1 disclosure: the antisymmetrized "wrong-sign" control was
   USELESS (transversality kills any k-carrying tensor) -- replaced.
 INTERNAL-LINE/SLICING: **UNDECIDED, exactly characterized.** POSITIVE
   CONTROL FIRST: the frozen FLAT vertex + gauge-image leg under EXACT
   conservation + on-shell TT companions = IDENTICALLY ZERO (the flat
   Ward identity, same machinery -- the apparatus detects genuine
   invariance). The dS insertion at loop kinematics is NONZERO at
   H^0/H^1/H^2; the H^0 on-support obstruction is EXACT:
   (7/2) i omega^2 q (X0 +- X3)(t11 - t22) -- external EOM factor x
   NULL gauge-parameter combos x internal-external TT overlap; +-q
   residues cancel neither in sum nor difference; direction-independent
   (3 exact-rational skew checks; symbolic skew run killed for cost,
   disclosed). Mutation controls nonzero and distinct.
WHY NOT A/B: Decl-5 wants Pi_nonlocal exact equality (undecided here);
no INTEGRATED mismatch exhibited either -- at matter scope A4's raw
orbit terms were ALSO nonzero (8675) and the K-term machinery disposed
of all. DECISIVE SCOPE FACT: A4's internal lines were SCALARS -- the
internal-graviton-line sector has NO precedent; this run supplies its
FIRST computed characterization.
THE PRICED COMPLETION: re-derive the A4 orbit/K-term/trace-cancellation
machinery on graviton content (charter gate D, sessions scale) -- its
input obstruction now precisely characterized.
SELF-SCAN TRAP: 6th appearance, caught (cache-name literals in the
independence check) -- runtime-built tokens.

the consequence pursuit here. CC-C unchanged; Axis-2 C; Gate-E A;

RECORD: WALL_KR_D4_KTERM_COMPLETION.md + machine JSON.
Frozen inputs byte-identical (D4-C artifact INCLUDED); register

CLASSIFICATION: **KTERM-A** -- the internal-line requirement PASSES.
D4 REMAINS C pending owner re-adjudication (no governance rule defines
this run as the formal D4 completion).

GOVERNANCE FINDING (stop-clause honored, then proceeded): the registered
protocol contains NO separate internal-line machinery -- at matter scope
A4's internal lines were SCALARS and carried no orbit, so none was ever
written. The registered "K-term completion" IS transversality +
trace-cancellation on the orbit direction (read verbatim from
wall_a4_response_dressed.py). The priced completion = that same
mechanism re-derived on the INTERNAL slot; cost/input obstruction
UNCHANGED.

ROUTE A (symbolic projector, |n|=1 by construction): K-half annihilated
for arbitrary direction/Y; trace-half annihilated for arbitrary lambda;
full orbit direction annihilated EXACTLY.
H-ORDER: the annihilation is INDEPENDENT of lambda (d/dlambda = 0) and
lambda is the ONLY H-carrier => H^0/H^1/H^2 each annihilated separately
-- UNIFORM in H, stronger than an order-by-order check.
ROUTE B (independent: explicit transverse orthonormal dyad + A4's TT
amplitude readout, 4 exact rational directions, no projector): both TT
amplitudes vanish everywhere. Shares only the frozen orbit DEFINITION.

**HONEST DIAGNOSIS OF THE D4-C RESIDUAL:** the D4-C Part-2 test inserted
the gauge image as a FREE POLARIZATION on the internal slot; the loop
contracts that slot with the bath propagator P^TT x W (T3 frozen tensor
rule, time rows zeroed by T2). The test BYPASSED the projector that
defines the declared bath. Decomposition category B = EXACT ZERO AFTER
TT PROJECTION. This corrects the BUILDER'S OWN interpretation; the
frozen D4-C artifact and classification are preserved.

SCOPE BOUNDARY (named): this is orbit robustness WITHIN the declared TT
bath. It does NOT establish that the TT-bath DECLARATION is the unique
admissible gauge -- that is D3(iii), owner-declared and underdefined,
NOT a D4 question and NOT answered here.

CONTROLS: omit-transversality -> K survives; generic insertion survives;
break |n|=1 -> annihilation fails; omit-trace-subtraction -> trace
survives (A and E prove BOTH halves load-bearing). The sign-flip control
is WEAK BY CONSTRUCTION (antisymmetric dies against a symmetric
projector regardless) -- flagged as weak, not counted as teeth.
NUMERICS: 6 random EXACT unit directions x 9 index pairs, annihilated
exactly in rational/radical arithmetic.

NEXT: OWNER REVIEW of the K-term result -- if accepted, D4 becomes
eligible for re-adjudication with both sectors resolved (external =
a54aa7f operator identity; internal = this completion), the D3(iii)
bath-declaration boundary explicitly outside both.

================================================================================
2026-09-02 -- D3(iii) OWNER RULING: CLOSED FOR CURRENT CONSEQUENCE SCOPE
================================================================================
INSTRUMENT: PHYSICS_LEDGER/wall_kr_d3iii_ruling.py (20/20)
DOC: WALL_KR_D3III_OWNER_RULING.md + machine JSON.
NO physics computed (the instrument imports no CAS at all); no new
parameter; frozen scientific artifacts AND the register byte-identical.

RULING (7 clauses, verbatim): the consequence object may be treated as
the registered TT-bath retarded TT response; gauge/orbit robustness is
required WITHIN that declared bath; NO claim that the TT-bath
prescription is the unique admissible general-gauge propagator;
alternative general-gauge/non-TT content remains separately scoped;
D3(iii) CLOSED FOR CURRENT CONSEQUENCE SCOPE, **NOT SOLVED AS A GENERAL
GAUGE-UNIQUENESS THEOREM**; frozen results unaltered; no new parameter.

AUTHORITY: charter STEP 1 (iii) says the graviton-sector state
prescription "must be declared, not assumed" -- an owner-declaration
slot. The prior Tier-2 D3 ruling (Option 3a, BD-analogue Option-B
adiabatic; IR = dimensional continuation only) is EXTENDED to the
consequence campaign's gauge scope, not replaced.

BASIS (sole): the contract's TT-bath definition (T2 frozen c5d399f5,
<hh> = P^TT x W) + the certified KTERM-A completion. VERIFIED EXCLUDED:
no consequence-class output, branch/memory/resonance outcome, Axis-2,
J(omega), plant/WC or benchmark artifact read or referenced; read-set
INTERSECTED with the outcome set is EMPTY.

WORDING DISCIPLINE (mechanically enforced): the record NEVER asserts
general-gauge uniqueness in any phrasing -- it states the negative as
"NOT CLAIMED". Forbidden phrasings are runtime-assembled and appear
nowhere in record or source; teeth-control confirms detection. Both
required statements recorded verbatim.

SELF-SCAN TRAP: 9th appearance -- three literals (the two outcome
artifact names in a later check, and the CAS name in its own forbidding
line) tripped the earlier source scan. All three runtime-built now.
STANDING RULE REAFFIRMED: never write a forbidden literal anywhere in an
instrument that scans itself.

NEXT: FORMAL D4 RE-ADJUDICATION consuming a54aa7f (external-orbit
operator identity) + 56b64c0 (internal KTERM-A) under this declared
scope. D4 remains C until that run. CC-C, Axis-2 C, Gate-E A, Noise A,
Lambda_R one, H^2 fork-gated -- all unchanged.

================================================================================
2026-09-02 -- FORMAL D4 RE-ADJUDICATION: D4-A
================================================================================
INSTRUMENT: PHYSICS_LEDGER/wall_kr_d4_readjudication.py (28/28)
RECORD: WALL_KR_D4_RE_ADJUDICATION.md + machine JSON.
Adjudication of EXISTING certified evidence -- not a new derivation.
Frozen artifacts (a54aa7f's and 56b64c0's included) + register
byte-identical; no new input; no new physics; NO consequence class.

CLASSIFICATION: **D4-A** -- all registered D4 conditions satisfied for
the declared consequence-scope object.

REQ (1) DISCHARGED: the orbit direction is BY CONSTRUCTION gradient +
trace = exactly Declaration 5's "trace + longitudinal" discards, and its
TT projection VANISHES (each piece separately, exact rational arithmetic,
5 directions x 9 index pairs). So the orbit moves content only WITHIN the
discard space -- that IS "the discards must map orbit-to-orbit".
REQ (2) DISCHARGED via the OPERATOR-IDENTITY ROUTE, licensed by charter
gate D's own clause ("agreement of TT content between gauges as an
operator identity where provable, exact symbolic check where not").
Bridge built in 6 steps, NOT assumed: (a) D5 compares two constructions
of the SAME linearized object; (b) any gauge transformation acts on the
spatial block as i(k xi + xi k) + lambda delta, INCLUDING the one
reaching synchronous gauge; (c) the certified identities annihilate that
form for ARBITRARY direction/xi/lambda, so (b)'s particular xi is a
special case; (d) per-configuration zeros integrate to zero => Sigma^TT
is the SAME object; (e) Pi_nonlocal is a PART of Sigma^TT, so identical
object => identical nonlocal part (EXACT equality); (f) the route is the
contract's own licensed alternative.
REQ (3) DISCHARGED STRUCTURALLY WITHOUT READING ANY VERDICT: D5 requires
Q1/Q3 to be IDENTICAL BETWEEN GAUGES -- an invariance statement, not a
value statement. Same object => same verdicts. Consequence firewall
intact: no Axis-2/J(omega)/benchmark/plant datum entered.
H-ORDERS: lambda is the only H-carrier and the trace piece vanishes for
ARBITRARY lambda => one uniform identity proves H^0/H^1/H^2 at once;
three separate calcs would be strictly WEAKER.

SUPERSESSION (exact wording): the prior internal residual is a
"SUPERSEDED INTERPRETATION OF THE EXECUTABLE TEST" -- NOT a deleted
result, NOT a physical contradiction. It came from inserting the gauge
image as a FREE POLARIZATION rather than the declared P^TT x W
contraction. D4-C artifact byte-identical.

CONTROLS (5): remove external transversality -> gradient survives;
remove internal TT projection / revert to free-polarization -> the
residual RETURNS (the superseded test itself); remove trace cancellation
-> trace direction survives; and THE DECISIVE ONE: any nonzero Delta_TT
between the two constructions fails the equality test -- the dispatch is
an EQUALITY TEST, not equivalence by fiat.

D4-A MEANS ONLY: the declared TT-bath dual-gauge/orbit requirement is
satisfied for the registered object. NOT general-gauge uniqueness, NOT
GRUT, NOT a consequence class, NOT low-frequency memory, NOT Lambda_R,
NOT the H^2 IR ambiguity.

DEFECTS (gate-side, disclosed): run-1 evidence gate matched prose
capitalization instead of the artifact's field name; run-2 trigsimp
idempotency contraction hit the 20-minute rule (re-represented to exact
rationals; the discard-space step needs no idempotency since the orbit is
gradient+trace by construction); run-3 quote gate missed a LINE-WRAPPED
clause ("map\n   orbit-to-orbit") -- whitespace-normalized. Physics
unmoved throughout.

NEXT: OWNER REVIEW. If accepted, the remaining consequence prerequisites
are the low-frequency/epoch-window fork-(ii) path and the
certificate-vs-manifest face ruling. CC-C, Axis-2 C, Gate-E A, Noise A,
Tier-4 banked, Lambda_R one, H^2 fork-gated -- all unchanged.
