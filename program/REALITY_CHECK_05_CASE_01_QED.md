# RC05_CASE_01 — QED anomalous magnetic moment a_e = (g-2)/2

> REALITY_CHECK_05 calibration case; frozen protocol, unmodified.

## Sources

- **J. Schwinger, Phys. Rev. 73, 416 (1948)** — one-loop a_e = alpha/(2*pi) `CANONICAL_PRIMARY`
- **S. Laporta, E. Remiddi, Phys. Lett. B 379, 283 (1996)** — complete four-loop a_e, 891 diagrams `CANONICAL_PRIMARY`
- **D. Hanneke, S. Fogwell, G. Gabrielse, Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 120801 (2008)** — a_e measured to ~0.28 ppb `CANONICAL_PRIMARY`
- **R. Bouchendira et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 080801 (2011)** — alpha from atom interferometry, independent of g-2 `CANONICAL_PRIMARY`

## Input ledger

- alpha (fine-structure constant) → EMPIRICAL_INPUT — measured independently (atom interferometry/Rb recoil), NOT from g-2
- m_e, m_mu, hadronic vacuum polarization, weak contribution → EMPIRICAL_INPUT (mu case) / negligible corrections (e case)
- QED Lagrangian + renormalization scheme → ASSUMED (declared theoretical framework)
- perturbation series coefficients c_1..c_4 → DERIVED_FROM_SOURCE (Schwinger .. Laporta-Remiddi)

## Model reconstruction

a_e = (c1)(alpha/pi) + (c2)(alpha/pi)^2 + (c3)(alpha/pi)^3 + (c4)(alpha/pi)^4 + c5(alpha/pi)^5, c1=1/2, c2=0.7309..., c3=24.050..., c4=1.181...(Laporta-Remiddi).

## Provenance map

claim -> coefficient derivation -> declared QED inputs -> primary papers. Alpha enters as an independently measured input, not fitted to a_e.

## Identifiability

Observable is uniquely determined by declared inputs at fixed perturbative order; truncation uncertainty is declared.

## Prediction analysis

PRE-REGISTERED structure satisfied: coefficients fixed by the theory BEFORE comparison; alpha fixed by an INDEPENDENT experiment; no parameter fitted to a_e; quantitatively testable (agreement at ~10^-12 level relative). PREDICTIVE = YES.

## Effective status

Not effective-truncated in the EFT sense; perturbatively truncated with declared residual uncertainty.

## Adversarial attack

Could alpha be a hidden fit? No: alpha is fixed from an independent observable. Could 'derived' be overclaim? The four-loop computation is a derivation from declared QED inputs; renormalization introduces an empirical input (alpha) explicitly, consistent with the protocol.

## Final classification
