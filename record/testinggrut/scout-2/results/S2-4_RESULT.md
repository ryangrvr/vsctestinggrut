## 1. Structure inserted vs forced

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| mixture weights | **forced** (uniquely ergodic frequencies) |
| convex combination of statistics | **forced given independence** |
| independence of settings from preparations ("free choice") | **inserted as a condition** (rational independence) — or Lebesgue-priced if called generic |
| inaccessibility of the coin | **inserted** (access) |
| "state = equivalence class over a test set" | **definitional**: the test set (access) is supplied |

## 2. Accounting

The supplied *randomness* of the operational framework is replaced by three supplied structures:
1. a hidden uniquely ergodic subsystem;
2. an inaccessibility (access) rule;
3. a dynamical independence condition between preparer and tester.

This is a genuine re-expression in **dynamical** terms (no probability primitive). It is not an elimination:
**ACCESS-PRICED + INDEPENDENCE-PRICED.**

**Observer loop.** The "tester" is a second deterministic subsystem (here, another rotation). The operational notion
of mixture needs **two subsystems with incommensurate dynamics**. That ties C5-D/E (states, probability) back to
C5-A (individuation of a preparer and a tester): **the observer is a subsystem whose independence must be supplied
or earned dynamically.**

**Status: S2-4 COMPLETE — convexity emerges deterministically with earned weights, iff the tester is dynamically
independent of a hidden coin (rational independence; access rule). Randomness is replaced by
access + independence, not eliminated.**
