## Grading rule and environment limitation

| grade | meaning in this screen |
|---|---|
| **PRIMARY / SOURCE-TEXT VERIFIED** | full text read. **Not achieved for any source in this screen**: arXiv / publisher / journal hosts are blocked by the egress proxy |
| **PRIMARY ABSTRACT VERIFIED (search)** | the search tool returned near-verbatim abstract text, attributed to the primary paper. Not fetched directly, so wording is close but unchecked |
| **SOURCE LOCATED, TEXT NOT RE-READ** | bibliographic record plus a partial snippet / summary only |
| **REVIEW / SECONDARY** | a review or third-party summary, used for discovery |
| **MEMORY ONLY — NOT VERDICT-BEARING** | background knowledge, not confirmed by retrieval |

**Rules applied:**
- Kill verdicts rest on **input accounting** (what the principle must be given). That accounting is visible at abstract
  level and in the frozen record.
- **No GO verdict rests on any search summary.** None was issued.
- **Retrieval route:** a census by four research sub-agents plus direct searches, all via search-engine output. arxiv.org,
  link.springer.com, quantum-journal.org, philsci-archive, OSTI and the metadata APIs were blocked.
