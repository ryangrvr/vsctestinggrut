# V0-1 — COMPARISON PHASE (P-17; the original was unsealed only after the reproduction was committed at `64b0182`)

**Original:** `playground/SCOUT_0/probes/P17_RESULT.md` (blob `5fc0401b…`) on frozen `scout-0 @ ab2da47`.

**Reproduction:** `V0_1_P17_REPRODUCTION.md` and `code/v0_1_*`. These were produced by a context-isolated sub-agent from
the spec alone. The independent derivation is **not** edited below.

## 1. Line-by-line scientific comparison

| item | original | independent reproduction | classification |
|---|---|---|---|
| Class 𝓗 / assumptions | harmonic modes; coupling linear in x_j and q, with counterterm; any smooth confining V | the same, derived from the Hamiltonian. It also makes explicit that the counterterm removes the potential renormalisation | **exact agreement** |
| Bath elimination | variation of constants plus one integration by parts | the same steps, re-derived and symbolically checked for arbitrary paths | **equivalent derivation** (standard; KNOWN: Ford–Kac–Mazur / Zwanzig) |
| Memory kernel | γ(t) = Σ c_j c_jᵀ/ω_j² cos ω_j t | identical; γ(0) equals the counterterm matrix | **exact agreement** |
| Free force | F(t) = Σ c_j{[x_j(0) − c_jᵀq₀/ω_j²] cos ω_j t + p_j(0)/ω_j sin ω_j t} | F(t) = Σ c_j[ξ_j cos ω_j t + (η_j/ω_j) sin ω_j t], with ξ_j = x_j(0) − c_jᵀq₀/ω_j² and η_j = p_j(0) | **exact agreement** |
| Preparation (P) | the free-force law is independent of (q₀, p₀); shifted-Gibbs satisfies it | the same, plus: with distinct frequencies this is equivalent to a q₀-independent law of (ξ, η); conditioning joint Gibbs gives shifted-Gibbs | **agreement** (the reproduction is slightly more explicit) |
| Product preparation | (P) fails; slip −γ(t)q₀; "noise vs memory filing is a bookkeeping convention" | slip −γ(t)q₀ confirmed exactly. It notes that a re-integration to a q-memory form gives a q₀-independent forcing law | **agreement**: the same point as the original's bookkeeping sentence |
| Equality of path laws | q = Φ(q₀, p₀, F) is the same measurable map in A and B; Volterra well-posedness; energy bound | the same structure, with regularity stated: Picard, plus an energy / Grönwall argument | **equivalent derivation** |
| Thermal law of F | Gaussian, mean 0, covariance Tγ(t − s) | identical. Also the random-phase fourth cumulant per mode is −(3/2)T²c⁴/ω⁴ (non-Gaussian) | **agreement** (the reproduction adds the explicit cumulant) |
| "Matched covariance suffices" | only for Gaussian preparations (H3) | only among Gaussian laws | **agreement** |
| Realisability converse | stationary Gaussian F with S_F supported where J > 0 has a harmonic parent with mode-dependent T(ω) | B → A holds only for laws supported on the bath's cos / sin span (finite bath) | **consistent**: the original's converse is restricted to stationary Gaussians with support condition, matching the reproduction's restriction |
| Ontology conclusion | reduced data identify the forcing **law** and the memory kernel, never the ontology, within 𝓗 | the same non-identifiability conclusion. **Qualification CL-1** on the positive side-claim: identifying γ needs M and V known (the reproducer's sufficient condition adds data across initial momenta) | **agreement on the theorem**; CL-1 is a **scope clarification** of an unqualified table entry |
| C-B interpretation (v) | the discriminator reads forcing-law cumulants; exact C-B only at WB + OD | **not checkable from the spec** (no C-B model definition) | **unresolved in V0-1**, deferred with C3 / C4 |
| Exact Taylor checks (C2), T1 – T8 | the logged values (2 modes n ≤ 8; 1 mode n ≤ 12) | **every value reproduced exactly**, with a distinct implementation (independent power-series recursions for A and for the GLE, with Wick pairing) | **exact agreement** |

**Implementation independence.**
- The original computes A by repeated Lie derivatives of the Hamiltonian, followed by a monomial expectation. The
  reproduction uses coefficient recursions in sparse polynomial rings.
- **Shared by mathematical necessity:** the GLE comparator's covariance identity Cov(F⁽ᵏ⁾(0), F⁽ˡ⁾(0)) = T(−1)ˡγ⁽ᵏ⁺ˡ⁾(0).
- No code was copied. The orchestrator re-ran the reproduction scripts, and all logs reproduced byte-identically.

## 2. Differences recorded

- **CL-1 (scope clarification, owner may reclassify as a correction).** The original's table states, without
  qualification, that "what *is* identifiable is the forcing law … and the memory kernel". Identifying γ from reduced
  data presupposes the system part (M, V). The reproducer gave a sufficient condition (variation of initial momenta);
  necessity was not shown. The **non-identifiability theorem itself is unaffected.**
- **No numerical discrepancy.** No sign, coefficient or assumption error was found.

## 3. Grade

**V0-1-A — P-17 INDEPENDENT DERIVATION REPRODUCED — VER-I1 (orchestrator-exposed).**
- The theorem, its assumptions and scope, the kernel, the free force, the preparation condition, the product-preparation
  slip, and **all exact C2 Taylor checks** agree.
- **Recorded alongside the grade:**
  - scope clarification CL-1;
  - C-B interpretation (v), plus the C3 / C4 checks, deferred (they need the external C-B model definition).
- **Qualifiers:**
  - **VER-I1, not VER-I2.**
  - **Orchestrator-exposed:** the orchestrating agent had read the P-17 proof earlier in the session. The reproduction
    was done by a context-isolated sub-agent from the spec only, and its file-access report is in the ledger.

**Owner option:** if CL-1 is judged a substantive scope correction rather than a clarification, the grade becomes V0-1-C
(reproduced with correction). The theorem is unaffected either way.

## 4. Owner ruling (additive; review of `f83c929`)

**Final grade: V0-1-C — P-17 REPRODUCED WITH CORRECTION — VER-I1 (ORCHESTRATOR-EXPOSED).** This supersedes the V0-1-A of
§3.

**CL-1 is a correction.** The original's unqualified positive sentence ("reduced data identify the forcing law … and the
memory kernel") is stronger than the theorem proves.

**Corrected verification reading.** P-17 proves that, for a fixed reduced system model, memory kernel and effective
forcing law, the hidden Hamiltonian-bath realisation and a matched exogenous realisation have identical reduced path laws.
Therefore the ontology realising the effective forcing cannot be inferred from those reduced data within class 𝓗.
Positive inverse identification requires additional conditions:
- identifying γ presupposes known M and V and sufficiently informative initial / interventional data;
- identifying the forcing law from the path presupposes enough of the deterministic reduced equation, including the
  memory term, to reconstruct the residual forcing.

**No theorem of unrestricted joint identifiability of (γ, Law F) was proved.**

**Reproduced successfully:**
- bath elimination;
- memory kernel;
- free force;
- preparation hypothesis;
- product-preparation slip;
- equality of path laws;
- the thermal Gaussian law;
- Gaussian covariance sufficiency;
- all of T1 – T8.

There is no coefficient, sign or theorem failure. Frozen `scout-0` is **not** modified. The correction lives only in VER0
and in later syntheses citing P-17.

**Criterion-2 item 1: COMPLETE at VER-I1, with correction.** The deferred C-B interpretation and the C3 / C4 checks do
not block it, and are listed as **not reproduced**.
