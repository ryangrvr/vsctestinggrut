"""bankgate: the bank-time gate that makes the self-audit LIVE.

The resident (propose/check_change) is a pure library; until now nothing forced a real edit to
claims.json through it, so 'self-auditing' was a property of the TESTS, not of the register. This gate
closes that gap: it diffs the working claims.json against the BASELINE SNAPSHOT claims.baseline.json
(UNCONDITIONALLY -- never git HEAD; see _resolve_baseline for the 2026-08-10 regression this rule fixed) and runs the resident's propose() on
every ADDED or MODIFIED claim.

  BLOCK              -> a discipline/structural violation (laundering, unresolved dep, cycle).
                        Exit 1: STOP the bank (the 'commit').
  FLAG-FOR-FIREWALL  -> a substantive change or a consistency flag (re-opens closed, builds-on-closed,
                        tier-contradiction, orphaned result, prior-lineage). Exit 0, but SURFACED for
                        the both-directions firewall + human relay BEFORE the change is accepted.
  CLEAN              -> no added/modified/deleted claim (working == baseline).

Every new scaffold node is born marked-open / borrowed with ledger_delta 0, so it surfaces as
FLAG-FOR-FIREWALL (substantive/new) -- never a silent PASS. The gate also reports the net-ledger drift
baseline->working; the net==+13 invariant is asserted separately in tests.

Workflow: edit claims.json -> `python3 bankgate.py` -> fix any BLOCK / firewall any FLAG -> once the
firewall + human accept it, refresh the baseline with `python3 bankgate.py --accept`.

bank_gate() is pure (reads nothing, writes nothing); all I/O lives in main().

    REGRESSION FIX 2026-08-10 (overseer-found, verified by execution): this function used to
    PREFER git HEAD when the tree was version-controlled. Before the repo was under git that
    branch was dead code and the gate baselined on the snapshot -- which moves ONLY when a human
    runs --accept, i.e. a real checkpoint. The moment `git init` ran (the pre-upload pass, commit
    2c522b20), the baseline silently switched to HEAD -- WHICH MOVES ON EVERY COMMIT. Effect:
    committing a register edit auto-accepted it; the corrections pass consumed its own pending
    flag. GIT INIT CONVERTED "COMMIT" INTO "ACCEPT". The instance list gains its cleanest entry:
    the act of making the register auditable disabled its audit checkpoint.

    Rule now: version control records HISTORY; the snapshot records ACCEPTANCE. They are different
    facts and the gate reads only the second. The seed path for a fresh tree survives below.
