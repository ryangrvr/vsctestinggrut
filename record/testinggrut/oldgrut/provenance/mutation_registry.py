"""mutation_registry: THE CALC-LAYER FLOOR -- the standing rule, in machine-readable form.

WHY THIS EXISTS (the honest reason, recorded so it is not softened later): TWO green-selftest
failures in two days.
  * 2026-08-03, calc/isw_tt_auto.py -- a spherical-Bessel Miller-recurrence start that ignored the
    argument. The selftest tested ONE point (x = 7.3) which happened to sit below the failure
    threshold, so PASS coexisted with constants that were pure numerical noise (the "edge" moved
    0.035 -> 0.27 on a single resolution doubling). Every number of that freeze was retracted.
  * 2026-08-03, calc/anomaly_c0_map.py (first build) -- the two most load-bearing facts (int C^2
    pure P2, int E_4 identically zero) lived in PRINT STATEMENTS behind a fabricated provenance
    parenthetical ("built from the full linearized Riemann") describing code that did not exist. A
    mutation test showed the selftest still passed with the ANSWER replaced by x = alpha^2 -- the
    single outcome that calc's own pre-registered directional guard declares must be an error.

Vigilance already failed twice. So this is STRUCTURAL, not a habit:

    *** STANDING RULE: every calc producing a load-bearing number ships a MUTATION BATTERY --
        the pre-registered WRONG answers (including the seductive one the directional guard
        names) -- and the battery must make the calc's own selftest FAIL. No number banks
        without one. ***

This file is the calc-layer equivalent of provenance/bankgate.py: bankgate intercepts register
edits; this intercepts NUMBERS. Enforced by provenance/test_mutation_battery.py.

THE RATCHET (the anti-softening device): OWED lists calcs that are cited by the register but do not
yet carry a battery. The test asserts OWED only ever SHRINKS -- a calc may be removed from OWED
(by giving it a battery), never added. A new load-bearing calc therefore cannot be introduced
without one.
"""

# *** THE CRASH-VERSUS-CHECK DISTINCTION -- fourth instance, so it gets its own line. ***
# A mutant that makes the calc CRASH proves nothing. Only a mutant REJECTED BY A CHECK shows the
# guard works, and test_mutation_battery enforces that separately from "did it fail". Four
# separate mutants have now been re-anchored for dying incidentally rather than being caught:
# a coth-residue probe that landed on another pole and divided by zero; a Taylor-index shift that
# zeroed a divisor; and two calcs whose checks fired but whose verdict string the harness could
# not recognise, so working batteries were recorded as crashes. WHEN WRITING A MUTANT, aim for a
# WRONG FINITE ANSWER, not for breakage -- and prefer the wrong answer that flatters the result
# you expect, because that is the one a guard is least likely to be built to reject.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- the batteries
# Each entry: calc file -> list of mutants. A mutant is (name, find, replace, why).
# `why` states WHAT WRONG ANSWER the mutant installs -- so the battery reads as a pre-registration
# of the failure modes, not as a code-coverage exercise.
# `slow` calcs are declared here and executed only under GRUT_FULL_MUTATION=1 (the suite stays fast;
# the DECLARATION is always enforced).
# `dir` names the directory the file lives in (default 'calc'); the rule is about LOAD-BEARING
# NUMBERS, not about which folder they sit in -- a tool in provenance/ that scores ledger
# arithmetic is exactly as load-bearing as a calc.

# ============================ THE COMPARISON RULE (ruled 2026-08-05) ============================
# *** ANY COMPARISON OF A PREDICTION TO A MEASUREMENT MUST REPORT BOTH AGREEMENT AND DISCRIMINATING
# POWER, OR IT DOES NOT SHIP. ***
#
# WHY. The Du et al. Sigma_0 wave produced a 0.38-sigma agreement between GRUT's mu/Sigma lock and
# the measured mu_0 -- and that agreement was reported as support. It is not: the same measurement
# separates the lock from GR at only 1.42 sigma, and mu_0 is itself consistent with zero at 1.0
# sigma. A BLUNT INSTRUMENT AGREES WITH EVERYTHING. Agreement without discriminating power is the
# ABSENCE of evidence wearing the appearance of confirmation, and it is the quantitative form of
# CHARTER Sec.4's match temptation.
#
# The rule generalizes past that paper and past this program: it is the same shape as every other
# defect here -- a check whose green state carries no information.
#
# MECHANIZATION: a calc listed below must expose, for every prediction-vs-measurement comparison,
# BOTH `agreement_sigma` AND `discrimination_sigma`, where
#     agreement      = |prediction - measurement| / combined error        (does it fit?)
#     discrimination = |prediction - null hypothesis| / measurement error (could it have not fit?)
# and a discrimination below ~2 sigma means the comparison CANNOT ADJUDICATE and must say so.
