"""expected_red: classification, not suppression -- declared at (test, CASE) granularity.

A suite that is always red teaches its readers that red means nothing, and a fourth failure hides
among three. But quieting a test that caught a real, unadjudicated problem would be adjusting the
instrument -- and adjusting the instrument that found your own error is the worst version of it.
So failures get a THIRD state: declared here, WITH the open adjudication each one waits on.

TWO HOLES IN THE FIRST VERSION, BOTH FOUND 2026-08-18, BOTH STRUCTURAL RATHER THAN LOCAL:

  1. IT DECLARED WHOLE TESTS. Several of these guards are SET-VALUED -- one test over every sealed
     pre-registration, one over every claim in the register. Declaring such a test red silences it
     FOR EVERY FUTURE MEMBER OF THE SET, and declarations here are permanent by design, so the
     blindness would be too. A third file with the very defect a guard was written against would
     have sealed cleanly, because the guard's failure was already on the books.
     FIX: every declaration supplies an ENUMERATOR -- the same function the test asserts on -- and
     the runner diffs the LIVE CASE SET against the declared one. A new member is a NEW RED even
     while the test remains a declared failure. It paid for itself on its first run: three cases
     were masked by fail-fast, and one declared case turned out never to have been detected.

  2. THE ADJUDICATIONS WERE UNCHECKED PROSE. Each declaration asserted "an adjudication is open"
     and nothing verified it. A pass closes, the test keeps failing for an unrelated reason, and
     this runner prints green while citing a ruling that already happened. Staleness cannot catch
     it -- stale fires only when a test starts PASSING.
     FIX: passes have ids in OPEN_PASSES.txt; every CASE cites one; an unknown or CLOSED pass
     fails in its own right. This too paid immediately: the four declarations turned out to span
     four passes distributed differently than they were written -- two declarations sharing one
     adjudication, and one declaration silently spanning two.

Nothing is silenced: every test still runs and still fails. This says only which failures are
known, at which cases, and what would close them.

Run:  python3 expected_red.py   -> exit 0 iff the failing set AND every case set is as declared
