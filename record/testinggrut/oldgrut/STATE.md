> **STAGE CLOSED 2026-08-09** (owner decision) — see `STAGE_CLOSE_2026-08-09.md` for the forest-level state, what was and was not done, and the two owner acts that remain. **[2026-08-10: the second act is DONE — the termination condition was SIGNED (v4, `f4bc613c…`, one page, gate-passed) and is IN FORCE; the signing entry and its three-part seam disclosure are in the companion event log. The remaining owner act is the dispatch send (under v4 no C1 window exists -- silence is still-open, unbounded; the only clock is the stop clock).]** The register below is **no longer held**: it grew on 2026-08-18 (`background_time_translation_flow`, +1) and carries substantive edits awaiting the firewall. Gates green, **bank-gate FLAG-FOR-FIREWALL** (three text-only edits to `rung3` plus the two flags standing since 2026-08-18), **net +15**, all seals verify. The plain-language account is `GRUT_V1_PLAIN.md`.


*One page, two-minute read: where the program is, for external review and the deposit decision. Snapshot 2026-08-02; register line and node count current as of 2026-08-09. Crystallization only — this ties the artifacts together; it does not re-derive or duplicate them. Register: **gate GREEN; net +15 (GRUT), 0 (cluster); 50 GRUT-scope nodes + 21 vacuum-cluster = 71 in `claims.json`** (37 GRUT claims: 26 Version I deposit + 6 Version II entry + `eft_operator_basis` + `zeta_interior_family` + the x-floor trio `passivity_channel_diagonal`/`x_no_pin_theorem`/`kk_static_transfer` (2026-08-09, each Δ0, overseer-ruled split; the transfer question answered same-day, staged); + 11 borrowed/open-field scaffold + `emergence_chain`, the building-stage construction node at Δ0 — the coverage map, `provenance/coverage.py`).*
<!-- REGISTER-SYNC: 53 nodes, net +16 -->
<!-- REGISTER-TOTAL: 74 = 53 grut + 21 vacuum-cluster; nets +16 grut, +0 cluster -->
*(Count disambiguation: **50** is the GRUT-scope claim count the sync marker tracks; `claims.json` holds **71** total = 50 GRUT + 21 vacuum-cluster. Nets: **+15** GRUT, +0 cluster. Anyone running `len(claims)` gets 71.)*
Of the **+15**, **+8 rides on four declared `laundering_ok` waivers** (`rung1_inin_action` +3, `rung5_gr_limit` +2, `rung6_qm_limit` +2, `p_tt_ansatz` +1), each carrying a written stance justification — `validate.py` prints the waived total on its own face.
*Vocabulary gloss for outside readers (added 2026-08-10 after an external reviewer reasonably misread it): **net +16** is the blind SUM of the register's underived-input ledger — the standing price of every assumption, updated on the 2026-08 response_lorentz_covariance retirement (+17 → +16, assumed→shown per the node's own retire clause, commit 8e64588; count 52 → 53 on the Tier-4 bank, commit d5e9a99; see claims.json) — not a count of new entries; **CLEAN** means the register is unmodified since the last accepted change. Neither is a progress metric.*

**What GRUT is (one sentence):** a disciplined open-system framing of the gravitational vacuum, screened claim-by-claim — **not a Theory of Everything, and it says so.**

---

## Version I — maximal closure under current physics (deposit-ready)

> **GRUT I does not establish a microscopic theory of the gravitational vacuum. It establishes the maximal closure of the responsiveness hypothesis under current physics, together with the precise points where further progress requires either new microscopic principles or advances in quantum gravity.**

26 claims, net **+12** (Version I deposit, historical). The honest crystallization:
- **Zero novel positive predictions** (`✓ derived = 0`).
- **Four derived boundaries** (GRUT-specific negatives): GW-dissipation **invisible-by-suppression** · the α→TT bridge **settled-negative** · an economical evolving w(z) **settled-negative** · μ=4/3 **excluded**. **[CORRECTED 2026-08-10, in the ledger's direction: the earlier "each clean of the open anchor" overstated — NO_GO_LEDGER's own calibration holds the w(z) entry's no-crossing component *conditional on the open `rung3`* ("a no-go cannot outrank its anchor"), held `to-derive`. Three of the four are anchor-clean; the fourth is anchor-conditional. Note also that `GRUT_V1_PLAIN.md` Part II selects a partly different four (normalization failure · endpoint exclusion · projector-as-choice · anomaly no-pin) and says so explicitly in its selection-honesty paragraph — the two lists serve different questions and are both labeled; the ledger is the authority on strength grades.]**
- **The responsive-medium ontology** (the one ontological bet) + responsiveness-as-constitutive + finite-memory-as-premise. *(Note: every surviving positive statement is **structural**, not numerical; every death was numerical — see `GRUT_I_What_Survived.md`.)*
- **A self-auditing method that, screened on itself, declined to bank itself** (weakly-novel synthesis of prior art; owes independent external validation).
- → `GRUT_I_What_Survived.md` (the label-for-label deposit), `NO_GO_LEDGER.md` (the boundaries), `SIGNATURE_AUDIT.md` (signature-null).

## Version II — OPENED (mapped, not resolved)
The universality program, under the **`u0` charter**: *every branch is a constrained classification problem with explicit failure states — never an ontology to defend* (`CHARTER.md` §8; the central object "constitutive organization" is defined provisionally in `GLOSSARY.md`). **Central question (inverted from "does GRUT generalize?"): *why do constitutive / response descriptions appear in every successful EFT?*** GRUT becomes a **probe** of the universality/microscopic boundary, not a candidate to validate. Six entry claims posed, default-BROKEN (ledger 0 each):
- **U1 (form):** universal — but **borrowed-standard** (Feynman–Vernon). A GRUT-specific *instance*.
- **U2 (kernel):** **under-determined**, first-gated on `rung3`. Also an *instance*.
- **U3 (origin of coarse-graining):** **fenced** against pre-answering "emergent".
- **U4 (origin of the constitutive form):** the central question; **fenced both directions** ("emergent" *or* "forced"). Deepest. Worked as a **classification tree**: **U5** (universality classes of χ) + **U6** (order parameter of constitutive organization) → an observable EFT — each with first-class *failure* conditions (only-one-class → responsiveness unique; reduces-to-monotones → info_i2-adjacent).
- **U5 & U6 now OPENED (not just posed), and CONVERGED** (all firewalled amber→green). **U5** — a **two-sector exclusion**: the responsive-vacuum constraints exclude the driven-dissipative Keldysh sector (KMS) and the *literal* Hohenberg–Halperin zoo (Lorentz + T_μν), leaving relativistic-passive-KMS viscoelastic transport; count *open*, fenced exclusion-only. **U6** — a discrete order-parameter **candidate** (the {reversible-bracket + conserved-charge-content} pair), independent-definition passed *conditional on coarse-graining*, fenced candidate-not-established. **The convergence:** one **deformability computation** settles both — banked at scaling level (`calc/u5u6_deformability.py`): it **factors** into KNOB 1 (RG-relevance / sharp-vs-deformable — *undecided*, a fixed-point research calc) × KNOB 2 (conserved-charge content — *decidable*), reducing the whole question to **"how many conserved charges beyond T_μν does the vacuum carry?"** Both horns live; neither claim graduated.
- → `GRUT_II_Agenda.md`, `POSTULATE_MAP.md`. **The single live in-house-adjacent frontier is now that deformability proof** (the fixed-point RG of the reversible couplings) — a research-grade computation, not another survey.

## THE CONVERGENCE (load-bearing finding) — three frontiers, not two
The whole program's forward uncertainty localizes to **exactly three distinct layers** — a three-layer stack, *do not collapse them*:

| | frontier | the question | register |
|---|---|---|---|
| **why-split** | **F2 — origin of coarse-graining** | why is there a system/bath split at all? | `u3_split_origin` (fenced) |
| **why-constitutive** | **F3 — origin of the constitutive form** | given coarse-graining, why a *response* structure rather than an arbitrary functional? | `u4_constitutive_origin` (fenced, deepest) |
| **which-kernel** | **F1 — the specific kernel** | what is GRUT's particular Σ_R (low-ω dissipative dS graviton kernel)? | `rung3` (derived-pending) — **spine test RUN** (2026-07-04, on the Tan–Tsamis–Woodard computed object): **earned UNDER-DETERMINED** + a derived **horn-conditional (forward-only)** — *the single-pole spine is naturally supported **if** de Sitter IR-screens* (Tsamis–Woodard vs Higuchi/Marolf–Morrison; converse unproven — not a biconditional) |

**Three levers, distinct in kind.** F3 (why-constitutive) is *not* covered by U1 (which presupposes the constitutive conditions) and is *distinct* from F2 (deriving coarse-graining does not hand you linear response). Finding the third frontier is a **truer map, not a new move** — F3 is the *least* tractable of the three (foundations-of-EFT), so the forward-gating is unchanged.

## The honest bottom line
GRUT's uncertainty is **not in its bookkeeping** (net +15) — it is in **unfinished foundational physics**, and the program has named *precisely which*. The `rung3` spine test was **run, not assumed** (2026-07-04) — then **independently reviewed by an external specialist** (the register's first logged external check), who reconstructed the same verdict and tightened it one notch (the un-resummed secular log establishes no cut either → the under-determination is *symmetric*): loaded onto the Tan–Tsamis–Woodard computed object, it returned **earned-under-determined** with a *derived* horn-conditional (forward-only: spine naturally supported *if* dS IR-screens; the converse is unproven — not a biconditional), a TT-frozen result that defuses the branch-cut/REFUTED reading *for the TT channel* (not evidence for single-pole — a frozen mode is equally consistent with trivial/no-response) **[SCOPING CORRECTED 2026-08-10, source-verified against the paper: the 'frozen' sentence is scalar-loop-scoped (its citation is Park–Woodard 2011); the graviton-loop T² carries ln(H²∆x²) on every Table-8 entry, so the trivial/no-response horn CLOSES for graviton-loop sources and the defusal weakens — under-determination persists on two named blockers (no graviton-probe assembly; the resummation tool HALF-DISCHARGED — the h_μ0 untangling half of the 2409.12003 deferral completed in arXiv:2507.04308, the RG half not: zero occurrences in its 24 pages, prerequisite re-deferred, authors "enjoin caution"); verbatim quotes incl. the SECOND CORRECTION 2026-08-10b (T² a coefficient function, in-out not retarded, Table 8 away-from-coincidence only, position-space log ≠ secularity) in `rung3_single_pole.boundary_condition`]**, and a documented in-house ceiling — so `rung3`'s forward move is now a **targeted, earned** specialist computation (the gauge-invariant assembled low-ω TT observable for the pure-graviton dS self-energy, arXiv:2602.07908), **not** an open-ended one. **Forward moves are external, not in-house:** that computation, movement on the dS-IR controversy, or progress in the foundations of EFT (F3). **No further in-house screen advances the physics.**

## 2026-08-02 — the verification wave + the parked queue (current standing)

The four-domain **observable hunt** (pre-registered A/B/C bar, adversarially refereed, every load-bearing number overseer-verified against primary literature) banked the **corrected empirical account** (`SIGNATURE_AUDIT.md`, dated section): the **scoped null** (*no observable above Grade C in the explored structure* — never "empirically silent"); the **DESI anti-signature** as the live threat (3.1σ honest headline, phantom-crossing shape the passivity no-go forbids — GRUT dies in this channel if it consolidates); the **α_M ≠ Im Σ_R category fence** (a detected Ξ₀≠1 could *never confirm* GRUT); and the **Γ_T literature anchor** (arXiv:2507.03103 — rung3's object class now has a mainstream name and a first loose slot-bound). The **T/ledger fork** adjudicated **T_SUBSUMED** (net stayed +12 at that adjudication; the restriction follow-up superseded it — see the +13 booking below; T-subsumption itself stands). Statement/body integrity restored across rung3/rung7/rung8/arrow; the constitution and deposit docs re-calibrated to "obstruction-backed, not impossibility-proof"; Brief 1 **SUPERSEDED**, Brief 2 partially stale.

**The p_tt interrogation is ANSWERED (2026-08-02): CHOSEN** — diffeo invariance buys transversality, not tracelessness (two Ward survivors; linearized EH itself carries a scalar kernel 2× its spin-2 one); ζ_vacuum ≡ 0 is a constitutive assertion. Banked in `p_tt_ansatz.boundary_condition`; question re-homed to u5 as "is ζ_vacuum = 0?"; `mu_linear` demotion opened as its own screen. **And the first net-ledger move of the program: +12 → +13** (the single-departure-shape closure booked as rung7's third input; four double-count checks recorded). **The interior is COMPUTED THROUGH THE RIGOROUS PASS AND HARNESS-INTEGRATED (2026-08-02, `zeta_interior_family` + `calc/mu_slip_interior.py`): μ(x)=1+xα exact in the inherited bookkeeping, Σ−1=(μ−1)/2 an identity family-wide, the window edge CORRECTED 2026-08-03 by the anchor computation (`calc/isw_exclusion.py`): ISW-cross at the endpoint is ~2.0σ (Σ-corrected; the ~32σ retired; mechanism direction was backwards) and DESI Σ₀ LENSING binds the family window — x < ~0.59 central-inputs, loose-upper per the F-MAP fence, μ−1 ≤ ~0.20 (binding inversion); the harness admits the interior structurally with the computed window edge in the data layer** — the first empirical surface of the GRUT family with a percent-level *ceiling* (vs 20-orders-suppressed); non-emptiness was structurally guaranteed and is not the finding; the natural points de-symmetrized (corrected 2026-08-03: x=α² survives all computed channels; x=α's un-disfavoring is central-inputs + F-MAP-fragile; the owed TT-auto calc is the discriminator). The `mu_linear` demotion screen **RULED (2026-08-03, overseer): retain_scoped + the statement WEAKEN edit applied**; the dissent recorded in-node; an **armed tier trigger** (rung3 resolving against the trace-correlator route → `derived-pending` → `assumed`); the separate-universe leg named **owed** alongside `isw_exclusion.py` (no in-repo computation; now the export's primary structural leg). `calc/isw_exclusion.py` **LANDED (2026-08-03, firewall-corrected same wave): outcome (b)** — cross-channel ~2.0σ (not 32; no in-family 2σ cross edge at central inputs), binding inversion (lensing binds, x < ~0.59 central-inputs/loose-upper per F-MAP), mechanism corrected; natural points de-symmetrized (x=α² survives; x=α F-MAP-fragile); separate-universe leg EdS-quantified (usable-but-conditional; owed residue = adiabaticity + the dilatation bridge); demotion trigger: condition 1 fired, condition 2 not — no tier move. **NEW OWED GATE: the low-ℓ TT auto-channel calc** (estimate-grade, order-10²σ-class; est. edge band ~0.03–0.14). **Queue (in order):** 1. **The x-floor question — "what pins x?"** — reconnaissance COMPLETE 2026-08-03: `X_FLOOR_MAP.md` (instrument, ledger 0) holds the four route maps, the decision tree D(Π₀, x*, x_edge^auto), the adjudicated attack order, and the pre-registered kill-conditions/trap fences. **Attack item 1 LANDED (2026-08-03): the TT-auto gate** (`calc/isw_tt_auto.py`) — first-freeze constants **voided by their own firewall** (Bessel bug → noise; the 0.035 edge and the 21σ/212σ "dead on arrival" adjudications are RETRACTED), rebuilt and **re-frozen** under amendments A1–A7: unconditional bound **x < 0.358**, κ=1 member 0.037, all named-point verdicts **κ-conditional**; normalization not a lever, the filter is the whole systematic. Owed at the gate: the A6 common-mode Boltzmann-grade check, and the new **activation-scale question** (is κ GRUT-derivable from the kernel's memory structure? — item 1b, high value: it would make every verdict unconditional). **Nothing from the gate is banked**; register untouched. **R1 LANDED (2026-08-03) — the answer calc returns NO PIN.** `calc/anomaly_c0_map.py`: the anomaly action does not assign the interior modulus a value; it realizes the dial as a *scale*, x_anom(k) = [1/(3α)]·k²/(k²+M_σ²), DC-zero (flat space; curved HALTED), the anomaly's own contribution ≥108 decades below every banked bound, the scheme piece free and unbounded (*that freedom is the finding*). **α-power = 0 as a computed output; x = α² structurally unreachable — the confirmation-bias trap did not spring.** Both D3 predicates fired; partial-pin rider (partial match); no tier change, ledger 0. Firewall AMBER→rebuilt (first build's key facts were print statements; now mutation-tested, 5/5 mutants caught). **Held for overseer:** two proposed register edits (a *strengthening* refinement of `rung9b_bridge`'s PRIMARY obstruction via the computed a/c sector-split; a correction to `eft_operator_basis` finding (iv)'s two-point clause), plus the finding that the **x ≥ 0 orientation lemma's fence was mis-homed on R1's sign** — re-home or unbank. **Remaining live pinning route: rung3's Π₀ only** (frontier-blocked), plus the activation-scale question (1b). (via R1 the x↔c₀ action-level map, the u5 dynamics classification, or rung3's bath microphysics; elevated by the overseer 2026-08-03: anything forcing x away from zero turns the family's *allows* into the program's first genuine percent-level *prediction* in ISW/growth/lensing; "nothing pins it" means deposit as ontology + derived boundaries + method — either way the question is decidable). 2. The TT-auto channel calc (the new owed gate, above). 3. `calc/gw_tensor_friction.py` (re-admit gate). 4. External dispatches (`SPECIALIST_BRIEF_rung3_spine.md` governs). **THE MERGE ARC IS CLOSED (2026-08-04).** The criterion is **v3.1**, reframed as a **declaration schema + structural validator, never an adjudicator** (cardinal invariant at the top of `merge_criterion.py`, 11 pins in `test_merge_invariant.py`). Its registry is **derived from the register** by a domain-free mapping, not authored — and the derivation overruled the builder on two of six proposed entries. A **borrowed/grut scope field** makes a reduction that eliminates only borrowed inputs structurally incapable of reading as a GRUT ledger move. **Banks = TRADE, not refuted.**

**GRUT's ledger: +15, with the corrected warrant** — *no relation is derived, so no input can be removed without booking a new one* (NOT "these are demonstrably different things", which was always stronger than anything shown). **The first n-sided check the ledger has ever had is complete:** `rung1`'s three declared inputs score TRADE (discrete −2, posit +1); every pair also scores TRADE at −1, so pairwise blindness concealed nothing. The Friedmann blindness is **closed at home**, not merely named. The textbook-limit triple scores TRADE likewise; the projector/anomaly triple **dissolved** — the register refused two of its three members, so its premise was false. **Audit the registry before the arithmetic.**

**Standing watch:** DESI DR3 + improved low-ℓ ISW cross-correlations (the window's edge).

## Current state, 2026-08-19 — the fortnight this snapshot had not recorded

*This section exists because, as of 2026-08-19, the prose above was history-stale at net +13 while the file's own machine-emitted
`REGISTER-SYNC` marker said +15. The marker was checked by a test; the sentences beside it were not.
That gap is now closed at both ends — figures corrected, and `test_doc_sync.py` extended to read the
prose as well as the comment.*

**The ledger moved once and has not moved since.** `background_time_translation_flow` was booked as
an **omission** at +1 on 2026-08-18 (net +14 → +15) after the charter's tell was run in full; its
mandated R5 edges were wired to `rung1` and `rung2` in the same edit.

**The static-patch frame migration was attempted and REFUSED.** Pre-registered
(`PREREG_FRAME_MIGRATION`, v1 sealed 2026-08-18, disclosure-only v2 `2f456d00…`), then scored:
**X1 fails** (the boost frequency and the comoving wavenumber admit no common eigenbasis —
`[K, P_i] = +H P_i`) and **X2 fails worse than the condition anticipated** (the static patch is an
exact Λ-vacuum; a sector with Ω_m ≠ 0 is a *different solution*, and no diffeomorphism relates
different solutions). **The −1 discharge was not taken.** `background_time_translation_flow` remains
`assumed` at +1.

**One result was published and retracted the same day.** A "gapped tower of quasinormal poles" was
reported, then withdrawn: the boundary-condition check tested that a hypergeometric factor was
non-zero at the horizon, which does not establish outgoingness. The retraction and its correction
are both in `calc/static_patch_tt_response.py`, and the free response is now known to be pole-free —
**null, not adverse**, since pure de Sitter is a trivial scattering problem.

**The graviton's `c` was derived in-house** (`c = 0`, axial sector, with the polar sector closing
analytically at M = 0), which is what makes the static-patch exhibit about GRUT's own object.

**`rung3` is where the fortnight landed, and it did not move.** Still `derived-pending`, Δ0. What
changed is its *decidability*: the free static-patch spectral function is now computed exactly, the
finite-temperature noise kernel is known to carry a Matsubara ladder at spacing H, and the node's own
2026-06-25 graduation argument ("Single-pole holds at finite T") is recorded as **not following from
its evidence** — it checked ω = 0, the one point where cancellation was possible. At fixed multipole
the surviving rungs are the entire infinite tower n ≥ l+1 with lowest rate (l+1)H, so **the node
asserts *the* memory time while the free theory supplies a family indexed by l.** Everything
remaining rests on the interacting self-energy Σ.

**`rung3`'s forward move is no longer the arXiv:2602.07908 specialist computation** described above.
It is a sharply posed question a dS QFT specialist can engage in an afternoon: *does the projected
memory kernel inherit the Matsubara ladder?* — with the escape route (spectral zeros at every rung)
shown to have **no free-level realisation**.

**Everything in the last fortnight is adverse or neutral to the framework except one item**, and that
one is weaker than first booked: de Sitter does split the flat-space centrifugal threshold zero onto
the Matsubara ladder, but its survival into the summed graviton bath is a kinematic accident of the
two missing partial waves.
