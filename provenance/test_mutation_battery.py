"""test_mutation_battery: ENFORCES the calc-layer floor (provenance/mutation_registry.py).

The standing rule: every calc producing a load-bearing number ships a mutation battery whose
mutants make its own selftest FAIL. This test is the enforcement -- the calc-layer equivalent of
the bank-gate.

What it checks:
  1. CONTROL       -- each battery calc passes UNMUTATED (otherwise "the mutant failed" proves
                      nothing).
  2. THE BATTERY   -- each mutant makes the calc FAIL. A surviving mutant is a test failure.
  3. ANCHORS       -- every mutant's `find` string still exists in its calc (so a refactor cannot
                      silently turn a battery into a no-op -- the isw_tt_auto lesson in a new form).
  4. THE RATCHET   -- OWED may only shrink; a load-bearing calc cannot be added without a battery.
  5. COVERAGE      -- every calc cited by claims.json is either batteried or explicitly OWED.

Slow batteries (declared `slow: True`) have their DECLARATION and ANCHORS enforced always, and
their mutants executed only under GRUT_FULL_MUTATION=1 (keeps the default suite fast without
letting the requirement lapse).

    _run() classifies a mutant as caught-by-a-check on the exact string "SELFTEST: FAIL". Two
    calcs shipped "SELFTEST FAILED:" instead -- no colon -- so their checks fired and were
    recorded as crashes: a working guard reading as proving nothing, the mirror of a broken guard
    reading as managed. Calcs that fail via assertions are fine (mech == "assertion"); this pins
    only the calcs that PRINT a verdict.

    THIS TEST WAS WRONG TWICE BEFORE IT WAS RIGHT, and the attempts are recorded rather than
    quietly rewritten, because the pattern is the finding. (1) It first required the literal
    "SELFTEST: FAIL" in the SOURCE -- nine false alarms, because those calcs build the marker with
    an f-string, f"SELFTEST: {'PASS' if ok else 'FAIL'}". (2) It then required the substring
    "SELFTEST: " -- one more false alarm, because print("  SELFTEST:", "FAIL") emits the right
    text from source in which the colon is followed by a quote, not a space. A guard checking the
    string instead of the behaviour, written to catch a guard checking the string instead of the
    behaviour, twice. (3) It now NORMALISES the line -- strips the punctuation that separates
    string literals -- and then asks for the colon form, which is what the emitted text actually
    depends on. Verified against all three idioms and against the real defect.

    THE STANDING LIMIT, since two wrong versions is enough evidence for it: a static read of a
    print statement cannot in general determine what it emits. The authoritative discriminator is
