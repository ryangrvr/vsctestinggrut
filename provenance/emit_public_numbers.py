"""emit_public_numbers: the ONE place any count in the public document comes from.

THE ONE-NUMBER RULE (overseer, 2026-08-12): no count is ever typed into prose. Every count the
public document uses is emitted by this script from the register on a stated date, and included
verbatim. The rule is a prohibition on the BODY, not an appendix convention -- and it is only real
if a script enforces it, which is what `test_public_numbers.py` does.

Run:  python3 emit_public_numbers.py            print the dated block
      python3 emit_public_numbers.py --write    write it to ../PUBLIC_NUMBERS.md
      python3 emit_public_numbers.py --check    regenerate and diff against the written block

The emitted block deliberately contains NO prose interpretation. It is counts and nothing else, so
that a reader can diff it against a fresh run without reading around an argument.

    Two defects sat here at once, found 2026-08-18 by a drift failure:

      1. TWO RULES OVER ONE DIRECTORY. The table listed every `*.py` in `calc/`; the emitted count
         `n_calcs` listed every `*.py` NOT starting with `_`. So the published table could carry a
         row the published count did not count, and nothing compared them. Fixed by making this
         the single source; test_public_doc pins table-rows == n_calcs.

      2. THE PUBLISHED DOCUMENT READ THE WORKING TREE. `os.listdir` sees untracked and GITIGNORED
         files. A mutant left behind by a mutation battery -- ignored, never committable -- had
         inserted itself as a row in the calculation index of a document that IS committed. A
         count of the program's own calculations that another clone cannot reproduce is not a
         verifiable number, which is the one property the one-number rule exists to buy.

    Read from a COMMITTED MANIFEST, not from the directory and not from a `git` call: this module
    must not shell out (test_the_emitter_does_not_recurse_through_pytest -- the drift check would
    run pytest from inside pytest, and adding a test would change the number the block asserts).
    build_calc_manifest.py regenerates the manifest; test_public_doc derives the truth from git and
    fails if the manifest disagrees, so the list cannot silently drift the way a hand-maintained
    one would.
