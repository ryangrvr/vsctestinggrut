"""emergence_chain: GENERATES the emergence-chain narrative from the register.

THE FIRST ARTIFACT OF THE BUILDING STAGE (2026-08-09). GRUT's nodes exist; the story does not --
nowhere is the sequence from origin to present laid end to end with each link's honest status.
This file constructs it. The construction asserts NO new physics: it places what the register
already holds into story order and marks each link.

THE ONE DESIGN RULE, and it is this build's own laundering guard: THE STAGE->CLAIMS MAPPING IS
AUTHORED (it is the construction -- position, story sentence, which claims cover the link, what
would strengthen it), BUT EVERY STATUS IS GENERATED from claims.json (tier, ledger_delta,
disposition, grut_standing). Narrative pressure is the laundering shape here -- a story wants to
flow, and the temptation is to soften a 'borrowed' into a 'follows from' so the chain reads
better. A generated status column cannot be softened without editing the register, and the
register has a gate. If a link needs something the register does not have, the link says OPEN /
SILENT / UNPOSED -- the story is not permitted to upgrade a claim to fit the sequence.

Run:  python3 emergence_chain.py          writes ../EMERGENCE_CHAIN.md and prints a summary
      python3 emergence_chain.py --check  regenerates to a temp string and DIFFS against the file
                                          (drift check: the wired-in defense against a narrative
                                          that wanders from its register)

## The finding — what the node list cannot show (Part 3; authored reading of the generated chain)

**1. The original content clusters in the middle, and both ends are borrowed or empty.** Links 2–6
(medium, persistence, arrow, thermality, gravity) every one carries an original result; links 3–5 —
the memory kernel, the KMS lock, the arrow decomposition — are the unambiguous core, and they are
exactly the open-system physics. Link 1 (origin) is **pure borrowed**. Links 7–8 (quantum,
classicality) are imports and an unbanked map. Links 11–12 (matter, observers) are silent and
unposed. The predicted shape holds, sharpened: **GRUT is a middle-of-the-story theory** — strongest
precisely where its own toolkit (dissipation, memory, detailed balance) does the work, empty where
that toolkit has nothing to grip.

**2. The chain's center of gravity sits on the ledger's only −1.** `rung2_kms_gate` — the shared
arrow/thermality node — is the one place in the register's history where the framework ever
*removed* an assumption (the KMS lock discharging the noise kernel as an independent input). The
story's strongest joint and the ledger's only negative delta are the same node. That is not
arranged; it is what the generated column shows.

**3. A soft marker, found by construction:** the register has NO structured field distinguishing
generic-shown ("true of any open medium") from GRUT-original-shown — the distinction lives only in
statement prose ("GENERIC — not uniquely GRUT"). The dark-energy and thermality links' original
markers partially ride generic halves (`rung7_w1_wz_map`, `founding_h1_zeta_casimir`). Any
generated status column inherits this blindness until the register grows the field; recorded here
rather than patched by prose-matching, per the resident's own precedent (prose scanning is a HINT,
never authoritative).

**4. The two ends differ in kind, and that decides where to build.** The origin end is a **priced
import sitting directly beside the strongest original result and the only −1** — the tools that
might work it (the arrow decomposition, the KMS structure) are adjacent and in-house. The matter
end is **silent with no adjacent original content** — nothing in the register grips it. If the
program builds anywhere, the chain says the origin end is the buildable end. (Part 4 of the brief
aims there; this finding confirms the aim from the artifact rather than from preference.)

**5. Bookkeeping gaps surfaced by the construction:** the constitution's assumed-list names "the
SM spectrum" and **no node books it** (the matter link's silence is a registry gap, not only a
physics one); classicality is entirely prose (mapped, zero nodes); and the generic-vs-original
field is missing (item 3).
