"""GRUT Forward-Model Harness -- the generative face (consistency-and-phenomenology of candidate universes).

Extends the resident from CLAIMS to whole MODELS. Sample a responsive-medium vacuum (a response-kernel
spec), turn the shown formalism's crank (the forward map: kernel -> observables), filter for ADMISSIBILITY
(the no-go checks + the resident's dependency/consistency discipline), and -- in a STRUCTURALLY SEPARATE
downstream layer -- compare to DATA. It tells you which responsive-medium universes are admissible and what
they predict; it NEVER tells you which is ours.

================================ THE CARDINAL INVARIANT ================================
The machine tests ADMISSIBILITY; only DATA tests REALITY. They are structurally separate. Every candidate
universe carries TWO INDEPENDENT fields:
  * admissible      -- from the discipline + the no-gos. admissible() NEVER receives data.
  * data_consistent -- from comparison to observation. Computed DOWNSTREAM of admissibility; it NEVER
                       feeds back into admissible.
No universe is banked shown/real for passing the machine. The strongest a candidate earns is
'admissible + predicts X + consistent-with-data-Y-at-current-precision' -- a CANDIDATE tier, never shown.
Merge the two fields and you have rebuilt laundering at the scale of whole universes.

DEFAULT-BROKEN: 'no admissible kernel reproduces our universe' is a first-class, valuable output.
NO TUNING-AS-LAUNDERING: a kernel that matches data only by violating a no-go or needing an un-sourced
input does NOT pass -- the data layer raises a laundering flag.
BOUNDED FAMILY: only responsive-medium-with-finite-memory universes; off-premise specs are inadmissible.

Pure Python stdlib. Reads the register (claims.json/sources.json) for admissibility; never writes it.
