"""test_physics_vocab: guards THE GUARDS of the physics vocabulary.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (recorded so it is not softened): the FITTED non-waivable ledger floor is the
anti-laundering device of the entire physics vocabulary -- it is what stops a fitted parameter
inheriting a datum's error bar and citation and reading downstream as empirically grounded. It was
shipped with NO test, and with zero fitted-tier nodes in the register, so it had never fired even
incidentally. A floor nobody stands on is a floor nobody has checked.

That is this program's DOMINANT FAILURE MODE, on its fourth appearance:
  1. a selftest passing while the answer lived in a print statement (anomaly_c0_map, first build);
  2. a "two independent derivations agree" check that was an algebraic tautology (same file);
  3. OWED_CEILING = frozenset(OWED) -- a ratchet computed from the list it was meant to bound;
  4. THIS -- the FITTED floor, real in code and completely unexercised.
All four are the same shape: A GUARD THAT VERIFIES ITSELF, or that nothing verifies. The response
is always the same -- make the guard fire in a test, against a case that would otherwise launder.

PROVEN TO FIRE (2026-08-04, by mutation -- a green test proves nothing until it is shown to fail
on a wrong implementation). Four mutants were run against validate_scoped.check_physics_extras and
ALL FOUR were caught by this file: (a) the floor made waivable by laundering_ok -- the laundering
door itself; (b) the floor silently lowered to 0; (c) POSTULATE's subtype made optional; (d) the
mandatory-rider check disabled. If any of those ever survives, this file has become decorative.

NOTE ON WHICH LAYER TO TEST (the overseer's own lesson from this session, worth encoding): these
rules live in validate_scoped.check_physics_extras, NOT in auditor.audit(). A test pointed at
auditor.audit() would return a false PASS for the floor and a false FAIL for the tiers -- a check
that tests the wrong object is worth exactly as much as a guard that verifies itself. So this file
imports the scoped validator and exercises the rules where they actually live.
