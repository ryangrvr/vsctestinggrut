# L0-1d — D-HERM-a (CYCLE AFFINITY): CHARTER + PRE-REGISTRATION (frozen before evaluation)

**Pre-freeze provenance.** This charter froze after an analytic-only
adversarial review: three reviewers, then a focused verification of
revision 2's new mathematics. No member dynamics, kernel, moment
sequence, Gram matrix, or member spectrum was computed at any stage,
so nothing is quarantined. The review is recorded in
`L0_1D_PREFREEZE_REVIEW_01.md`. It ran under the adopted floor
termination condition (`L0_1_FLOOR_TERMINATION_ADOPTION_01.md`).

**Fork:** L0-1d, the first floor fork. It works on obligation **O-1**.
**Authority:** registry rulings R-1 … R-4 (R-3 at declared
linear-class scope); design basis `L0_1_FLOOR_DESIGN_01.md`. The
owner's four prohibitions bind. **Preview discipline:** no member
dynamics, kernel, Gram matrix, or member spectrum was computed to
write this charter or to review it. Every claim is a theorem, a
definition, or a labeled analytic expectation.

## 0. The frozen question, the hypothesis, the outcomes

> **When the generator stops being self-adjoint, is it asymmetry
> itself, or cycle affinity (broken detailed balance), that bears on
> the tested response properties?**

**H-HERM-1 (under attack):** cycle affinity, not asymmetry as such,
bears on P_positivity component (c), complete monotonicity (CM). It
does not bear on P_memory, whose exponential envelope accretivity
holds by identity.

**What the fork certifies vs what theorems already fix (stated first,
per the review):**
- **Theorem (Kolmogorov + F-1):** zero cycle affinity with
  sign-consistent couplings makes the generator diagonally
  symmetrizable. The retained-site kernel is then exactly that of a
  symmetric **reciprocal twin**, so it is exactly CM. *Affinity is
  necessary for a CM breach* is therefore a theorem, not a finding.
- **Analytic, not theorem (§3.5):** that every declared circulating
  member *does* breach CM. At small γ this is a theorem (§3.5); at the
  declared γ it is not.
- **Certified by this run:** the exact CM status of every declared
  member (a finite exact computation, §2); the P_memory reading at
  every member; and the maps.

**Outcomes (per-property, never composed):**
- **Outcome A, a zero-affinity member leaves the reciprocal class:**
  identity-impossible, so it is HALT (RC-3, RC-8).
- **Outcome B, the affinity split (the target):** every zero-affinity
  member is exactly CM, every circulating member is exactly not CM,
  and the memory envelope reading survives everywhere.
- **Outcome C, affinity without a CM breach:** some circulating
  member is exactly CM. This is a genuine, exact falsification of
  H-HERM-1's CM half at that member. It would mean the retained site
  sees no non-real pole, no negative residue, and no higher-order
  pole there.

**Held fixed:** the symmetric part K_s of every ring member, so
**accretivity (R-4) is held by construction.** Every member is also
Metzler (§3.3), so nonnegativity, component (a), is held by identity.
**Disclosed limitation (review finding):** K_s and the edge products
K_ij·K_ji cannot both be held fixed. Holding K_s makes every deformed
edge's product 1 − γ²a_e². The reciprocal twins (§1) separate that
renormalization from affinity.

## 1. Members, twins, conventions (frozen)

Kernel object: k(τ) = e₁ᵀe^{−Kτ}e₁ on a 23-dimensional bath block,
where e₁ is the site attached to the system.

**Conventions.** Sites 1…23. Ring edge e_i = (i, i+1) for i = 1…22,
and edge e₂₃ = (23, 1). An antisymmetric deformation with pattern a
sets K_{i,i+1} = −(1 − γa_i) and K_{i+1,i} = −(1 + γa_i), so transport
i → i+1 has rate 1 + γa_i. **Cycle affinity:**
𝒜 = Σ_i ln[(1 + γa_i)/(1 − γa_i)].

**Tree set T (the record's anchor; F-1 instantiation).** K_b = the
(1:, 1:) block of `build_K(24, 0)`, equal to 0.3I + L_path + e₁e₁ᵀ,
deformed along the 22 path edges with a_i = 1. **γ_T ∈ {0, 0.9}.**
γ = 0 is the sealed anchor.

**Ring substrate.** K_s = K_b + (e₁ − e₂₃)(e₁ − e₂₃)ᵀ: the tree bath
plus the closing spring (23, 1). Its diagonal is 3.3 at site 1 and 2.3
elsewhere.
- **Circulating members C(γ):** a_i = 1 on all 23 edges, so
  𝒜 = 23·ln((1+γ)/(1−γ)). **γ_C ∈ {0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9}.**
- **Balanced members B(γ) (zero affinity, same K_s, the
  asymmetry-without-affinity control the review asked for):**
  a_i = +1 for i = 1…11, −1 for i = 12…22, 0 for i = 23, so 𝒜 = 0
  exactly. **γ_B ∈ {0.3, 0.9}.**
- **Reciprocal twins S(γ) (references only, no trajectories):** the
  symmetric matrix with K_s's diagonal and every ring edge coupling
  −√(1 − γ²). S(γ) has the same edge products as C(γ) and zero
  affinity. Its moments equal C(γ)'s for every order n ≤ 22, because
  only walks that wind all the way round the ring (at least 23 steps)
  see affinity. **For γ_C ∈ {0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9}.**
- **The tree twin S_T(γ)** = diag(K_b) − √(1−γ²)·Adj_path, the F-1
  reference for T(γ). Here "twin" never means K_s.

**Member roles:** T(0), C(0), B(·), and T(0.9) are zero-affinity,
identity-protected members. **C(γ > 0) are the adjudicating members.**
All γ values are exact rationals (1/10, 3/10, 3/5, 9/10), so every
exact computation in §2 is exact in ℚ.

## 2. Instruments and batteries (frozen)

**Instrument E (exact, static; R-3 at declared linear-class scope).**
**Exact construction (mandated):** each member is built as the
**integer matrix M = 10K** from exact integers: diagonal 33 at site 1
and 23 elsewhere on the ring, K_b's 23 and 13 on the tree, and
off-diagonals −10 ± 10γa_i. These are never converted from floats.
Every entry is asserted equal to the float instrument's K, entry by
entry, as float(M/10) == K (RC-9). Scaling by 10 is a congruence
(diag(10ⁱ)) on the Hankel matrices: it leaves inertia, definiteness,
and Sturm counts unchanged. For each member, compute exactly:
- the Krylov vectors vₙ = Mⁿe₁;
- the moments sₙ = (vₙ)₁ for n = 0 … 47;
- the Krylov dimension r, the exact rank of [v₀ … v₂₃];
- **the atom count d**, the exact rank of the 24×24 Hankel matrix
  [s_{i+j}], 0 ≤ i, j ≤ 23. d is the McMillan degree of the
  retained-site response, and d ≤ r;
- the Hankel matrices H₀ = [s_{i+j}] and H₁ = [s_{i+j+1}],
  0 ≤ i, j < d. By Kronecker's theorem the leading d×d block is
  nonsingular.

**Exact CM test:** k is CM ⟺ H₀ ≻ 0, with H₁ ≻ 0 identity-held given
H₀ ≻ 0 (§3.4). Definiteness is tested by exact Gaussian elimination
without pivoting. It stops at the first pivot ≤ 0 and declares "not
PD". Pivot k equals D_k/D_{k−1}, so "all pivots > 0" is exactly
Sylvester's criterion. The theorem is §3.4.

**Exact mechanism map (ungated):**
- the retained-site recurrence polynomial p: monic, **degree d**, the
  minimal linear recurrence of the moment sequence. It is not the
  Krylov minimal polynomial, which can carry zero-residue poles;
- squarefreeness (gcd(p, p′));
- the number of distinct real roots, by an exact Sturm sequence with
  signs at ±∞ read from leading coefficients;
- the inertia of H₀ (signs of its exact pivots), when no zero pivot
  arises;
- d versus r at every member.

**Instrument B (time-domain, eigen-free; P_memory and maps).**
x(0) = e₁, ẋ = −Kx, k(τ) = x₁(τ). RK4 on L0-1c's integer-count
schedule, carried verbatim: 10000 steps of h₁ = 10⁻⁴, then 15600 steps
of h₂ = 2.5×10⁻³. Recordings are made at step indices, and τ is never
accumulated. Every trajectory also gets a halved-schedule audit.
- **P_memory:** the RC-7-certified textual copy of `fit_residuals` +
  TAUS, applied to the discrete envelope
  E(τ_i) = max_{j ≥ i} |k(τ_j)| over the recorded gated grid (R-1).

**Eigen references (`jacobi_eig`, symmetric matrices only):** the
sealed anchor; S_T(0.9); C(0) (symmetric); the twins S(γ); every
member's K_s (for μ = λ_min(K_s)). `jacobi_eig` is also used on the
symmetric data Gram of the ungated operational map.

**Operational Gram map (ungated; measures what a trajectory battery
can see):** G_ij = k(τ_i + τ_j), τ_i ∈ {1.0, …, 20.0}. The minimum
eigenvalue is recorded, both full and halved schedule, at every
member.

**Grids:** gated τ ∈ [1, 40] step 0.5; early τ ∈ [0.05, 0.95] step
0.05. **Trajectories:** 9 members × (full + halved) = **18**.

## 3. Honesty note, stated before the run (identities first)

1. **F-1, reciprocal twin (identity).** For |γ| < 1, T(γ) is
   diagonally similar to S_T(γ), so k_{T(γ)} = k_{S_T(γ)} exactly.
   Likewise B(γ) is diagonally similar to its own symmetric twin
   **S_B(γ)**, because its single cycle is balanced (Kolmogorov). S_B(γ)
   has K_s's diagonal, couplings −√(1−γ²) on edges 1–22, and −1 on edge
   23, so it is *not* S(γ). All twins are strictly diagonally dominant,
   and therefore positive definite. **These kernels
   do change with γ;** what is identity-held is that they stay in the
   reciprocal (exactly CM) class. RC-3 and RC-8 instantiate this.
2. **Accretive envelope (identity).** K_s ⪰ μI gives
   |k(τ)| ≤ ‖e^{−Kτ}‖₂ ≤ e^{−μτ}. μ = λ_min(K_b) ≈ 0.3045 on T, and
   μ > 0.3 strictly on the ring. RC-6 instantiates this. The
   exponential *bound* on memory is therefore identity-held at every
   member. The comparator's *grade* on E is not fixed by it.
3. **Metzler sign (identity).** Every off-diagonal entry of −K is
   1 ± γa_i ≥ 0 and e₁e₁ᵀ is diagonal only, so k(τ) ≥ e^{−(max
   diag)τ} > 0. RC-5 instantiates this.
4. **The exact CM theorem behind Instrument E.** Here k is an
   exponential polynomial whose moments sₙ = (−1)ⁿk⁽ⁿ⁾(0) satisfy the
   minimal recurrence p, of degree d. By Bernstein's theorem and the
   linear independence of τᵐe^{−λτ}, k is CM ⟺ every pole is real and
   ≥ 0, every residue is positive, and there is no τᵐ (Jordan) term.
   That excludes a non-real pole, a negative residue, and a
   higher-order pole.
   - **The atom count is the McMillan degree d**, the rank of the
     infinite Hankel matrix, which can be smaller than the Krylov
     dimension r. The verification's toy counterexample:
     K = [[1,0],[1,2]] has r = 2 but k = e^{−τ}, with d = 1. So the
     test is sized by d.
   - With d atoms, H₀ = VᵀCV for a nonsingular (confluent) Vandermonde
     V. Each real simple atom contributes the sign of its weight; each
     complex pair contributes inertia (1,1); each Jordan block of size
     m ≥ 2 contributes at least one positive and one negative
     direction. **So H₀ ≻ 0 ⟺ all d atoms are real and simple with
     positive weights** (finite Hamburger/Hermite).
   - H₁ = VᵀCΛV. Given H₀ ≻ 0 the atoms are real eigenvalues, which are
     ≥ μ > 0.3 by accretivity, so **H₁ ≻ 0 is identity-held.** An
     H₁-only failure is therefore HALT (RC-10), never a CM breach.
   - d = r is identity-held at the zero-affinity members (H₀ = WᵀW) and
     at C(γ) whenever its spectrum is simple (H₀ = WᵀRW, with every
     Krylov-space eigenvector carrying a nonzero residue). d < r can
     occur only at a non-generic degeneracy; it is mapped at the C
     members.

   The test is exact: no tolerance, no integration, no floating point.
5. **Why a circulating member should breach CM (analytic, not
   theorem).** The review corrected the charter's earlier circulant
   picture, which ignored the e₁e₁ᵀ defect and was wrong at small γ.
   - Let R be the ring reflection fixing site 1. Then RK(γ)R = K(γ)ᵀ,
     so K is self-adjoint in the indefinite form xᵀRy, and the kernel
     is even in γ.
   - At γ = 0, the 11 R-odd modes vanish at site 1. The 12 R-even
     modes strictly interlace them, so the spectrum is simple.
   - **Hence the spectrum stays real for small γ > 0** (γ below the
     first collision, an exceptional point).
   - In that real phase, the weight of an odd-born mode is
     cⱼ = (vⱼ,₁)² / (vⱼᵀRvⱼ), with vᵀRv = −1 + O(γ²).
   - **Small-γ theorem (supplied by the focused verification):** the
     commutator [K_s, P − Pᵀ] = e₁(e₂−e₂₃)ᵀ + (e₂−e₂₃)e₁ᵀ gives
     v′ⱼ,₁(0) = −2φⱼ,₂·Σ_m u²_{m,1}/(oⱼ − ν_m)². Every term of the sum
     has one sign, and φⱼ,₂ ∝ sin(2πk/23) ≠ 0. **So
     cⱼ = −4γ²φ²ⱼ,₂(Σ_m u²_{m,1}/(oⱼ−ν_m)²)² + O(γ⁴) < 0: for all
     sufficiently small γ > 0, exact CM is broken through negative real
     weights, with no oscillation.** The verifier checked the formula
     against a 3-site toy ring (not a member) to about 10⁻³ relative.
   - Beyond an exceptional point, non-real poles break it.

   A breach is therefore a theorem for sufficiently small γ. At the
   declared γ ∈ {0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9} it stays **analytic-leaning**:
   "sufficiently small" is not bounded, and the exceptional-point
   locations are not derived.
6. **Labeled analytic expectations for the maps (recorded to be
   confirmed or refuted; they move no label):**
   - C(0.1) is in the real phase: the Sturm count equals r, and p is
     squarefree.
   - H₀ inertia at C(0.1) shows negative pivots, consistent with
     negative real weights.
   - The operational Gram minimum eigenvalue at small γ is at or near
     the integration floor. That would mean the trajectory battery
     cannot see a breach the exact battery does see, at least at the
     smallest γ.
   - Somewhere in (0.1, 0.9], exceptional points appear, and the Sturm
     count drops below r.
7. **Classification.**
   - *Identity-grade:* RC-3, RC-5, RC-6, RC-8, and every zero-affinity
     member's exact-CM result.
   - *Analytic-leaning:* H-1, the exact breach at every C(γ > 0); M-1
     on T(0), which is sealed.
   - *Not banded, genuinely attackable:* M-1 on T(0.9), B(·) and the
     C members. The E-staircase of an oscillating kernel could flip the
     comparator's grade; §5 routes such a flip.
   - *Also not banded:* X-1′ (§4). Moments agree with the twin up to
     n = 22, so the affinity effect is late-onset, and a null is
     possible.
   - *Genuinely unpredicted (maps):* phase structure, exceptional-point
     location, operational detection versus exact breach, and E(40)
     and tails.
   - **Component (b), monotone decrease, is not adjudicated.**
     H-HERM-1 makes no claim about it; it belongs to H-HERM-2 (O-2).
     It is mapped.
8. **F-7 corrected (the review's finding; the owner's O-2 ruling
   applied).**
   - F-7 is an **observability/identity result about the retained-site
     observable**, never evidence about accretivity or H-HERM-2's
     physics. It holds only for generators diagonally similar to a
     normal matrix. For a single directed weighted cycle that requires
     a **uniform diagonal** (and a nonzero return weight).
   - **The record's attachment convention (e₁e₁ᵀ) breaks that
     hypothesis**, so F-7 does **not** cover the natural O-2 candidate:
     the attached, spectrally stable, non-accretive directed ring.
   - Even where F-7 applies, it excludes only growth above
     e^{−min Re λ·τ}. It does not make the kernel "invisible".
   - **O-2 is therefore not deferred on F-7 grounds.** The attached
     directed ring is a live O-2 candidate for its own charter.
     "Perron weight at e₁ above 1" is recorded only as a sufficient
     witness of non-normal-similarity, not a necessary condition.
   - *Cross-reference note:* the owner's adoption record
     (`L0_1_FLOOR_TERMINATION_ADOPTION_01.md`) cites F-7 as "§3.7",
     which was its location in draft revision 1. In this revision it is
     §3.8. The owner's record is not edited.

## 4. The gates (frozen, mechanical)

**Controls and identities (halt-grade; a breach anywhere is HALT):**
- **RC-1 replication:**
  - the eigen-form anchor k(40) = 6.8195192260507686×10⁻⁹
    (|rel Δ| < 10⁻⁹);
  - the anchor time-domain run matches its eigen form,
    sup |k_td − k_eig|·e^{μτ} < 10⁻⁶ on the gated grid.
- **RC-2 halved-schedule audit, every trajectory:**
  sup |k_full − k_half|·e^{μτ} < 10⁻⁶. This is envelope-normalized,
  per the review's analytic RK4 bound; a relative-to-k tolerance would
  be infeasible at the minima of an oscillating kernel.
- **RC-3 reciprocal twins, time-domain:** k_{T(0.9)} matches the eigen
  kernel of S_T(0.9), and k_{C(0)} matches its own eigen kernel. Both
  checks use sup |Δk|·e^{μτ} < 10⁻⁶.
- **RC-5 sign:** k > 0 at every recorded point of every trajectory.
- **RC-6 accretive envelope:** |k(τ)| ≤ e^{−μτ}(1 + 10⁻⁹) at every
  recorded point of every member.
- **RC-7 comparator certification (R-1 instantiated):**
  - on the **eigen-form** anchor kernel, E = k exactly at every gated
    point;
  - the comparator on E reproduces R_exp = 1.9809889100368165 and
    R_alg = 4.7907669413552245 (|Δ| < 10⁻¹² each) and the grade string
    "EXPONENTIAL-GRADE" exactly.
- **RC-8 exact CM on every zero-affinity member (identity):** d = r,
  and H₀ ≻ 0 exactly, at T(0), T(0.9), C(0), B(0.3), and B(0.9).
- **RC-9 exact-construction self-check:**
  - every entry of each integer matrix M satisfies float(M/10) == the
    float instrument's K entry, exactly;
  - at C(0), r = d = 12 exactly (the R-even sector; the 11 odd modes
    have zero overlap with e₁);
  - at T(0), r = d = 23.
- **RC-10 H₁ identity:** at every member where H₀ ≻ 0, H₁ ≻ 0 as well
  (§3.4). An H₁-only failure is HALT.

**X, the affinity deletion acts in the window (conditions only the
P_memory line):**
- **X-1′:** at C(0.9), sup over the gated grid of
  |k_{C(0.9)} − k_{S(0.9)}|·e^{μτ} > 0.01. This is not banded (§3.7).

**The response properties:**
- **H-1, P_positivity (c), exact (the H-HERM-1 gate; analytic-leaning):**
  every adjudicating member C(0.1), C(0.3), C(0.6), C(0.9) fails the
  exact CM test: **H₀ (size d) is not ≻ 0.** d versus r is recorded
  per member. If d < r occurs at a C member, it is disclosed on the
  verdict face as a non-generic degeneracy, and the test is still run
  at size d.
- **M-1, P_memory (R-1 envelope reading):** the comparator on E reads
  EXPONENTIAL-GRADE at every member.
- **Maps (ungated):**
  - the exact mechanism map (r, squarefreeness, Sturm real-root count,
    H₀ inertia) at every member;
  - operational Gram minimum eigenvalue (full and halved) at every
    member;
  - the monotone-decrease status of component (b) at every member;
  - E(40) and tail slopes;
  - 𝒜 and μ per member;
  - the early-grid transient map;
  - |k_C − k_S| per γ.

## 5. Outcome rule (frozen, mechanical; lines never composed)

**Scope clause, on the face of every recorded line under every
outcome, including PARTIAL and HALT:** *within the declared background
mathematics — exact rational arithmetic for Instrument E, the frozen
RK4 schedule for Instrument B, and exact symmetric eigendecomposition
for the identity references — the declared members T ∈ {0, 0.9},
C ∈ {0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9}, B ∈ {0.3, 0.9} on the sealed C1 bath and
its one-spring ring closure, with K_s held, and the declared window,
grids, and comparator.*

**The lines:**
- **L-1 · NON-RECIPROCITY WITHOUT CYCLE AFFINITY: REDUCIBLE TO A
  RECIPROCAL TWIN (identity-grade; F-1 and Kolmogorov
  instantiated).** Issued iff RC-3 and RC-8 hold. Its face states that
  these kernels change with γ and stay in the reciprocal class.
- **L-2 · CYCLE AFFINITY: BREAKS P_positivity (c), complete
  monotonicity, exactly, at every declared circulating member.**
  Issued iff H-1 holds. Its face:
  - (i) *necessity of affinity for any breach is a theorem*;
  - (ii) *the breach at each declared member is certified by exact
    computation*;
  - (iii) components: **(c) adjudicated exactly; (a) held by identity
    at all members; (b) not adjudicated, mapped.**
- **L-3 · CYCLE AFFINITY: NOT-LOAD-BEARING for P_memory (R-1 envelope
  reading; accretivity held).** Issued iff M-1 holds and X-1′ holds.
- **M-1 failure at any member while RC-6 is clean:** recorded as
  **COMPARATOR-LIMITATION.** The comparator graded E ALGEBRAIC although
  the identity-held bound |k| ≤ e^{−μτ} holds. This is an instrument
  finding, never "affinity load-bearing for P_memory". L-3 is not
  issued, and the run label is L01D-PARTIAL.
- **X-1′ failure:** L-3 is not issued (the memory line would be
  vacuous). L-1 and L-2 are unaffected. Run label L01D-PARTIAL.

**Run labels:**
- **Outcome B (the affinity split):** L-1, L-2, and L-3 all issue.
  Recorded as: *on one substrate with one symmetric part,
  zero-affinity asymmetry keeps the retained-site kernel exactly in the
  reciprocal, completely monotone class; cycle affinity takes it out
  of that class at every declared member; the exponential memory
  envelope survives throughout.*
- **Outcome C (affinity without CM breach):** RC clean, and some
  C(γ > 0) passes the exact CM test. H-HERM-1's CM half is **exactly
  falsified at the listed members.** L-1 and L-3 are still issued or
  withheld on their own conditions.
- **L01D-PARTIAL:** comparator limitation, X-1′ failure, or any other
  non-RC gate failure.
- **HALT:** any RC breach.
- **Precedence (run labels only):** HALT > Outcome C > L01D-PARTIAL.
  Outcome B requires all three lines. The precedence composes no lines
  and suppresses none.

**Mapping to O-1's terminal labels** (proposed; the owner assigns the
label, per T2):

| Run outcome | Supports | Uses O-1's one re-charter? |
|---|---|---|
| Outcome B | **CLASS-SPLIT** for P_positivity (c): zero-affinity class exactly CM, affinity class exactly not CM, same substrate. L-3 is certified inside it. | no |
| Outcome C | **FALSIFIED** (H-HERM-1's CM half), terminal | no |
| L01D-PARTIAL / HALT | non-terminal | **yes.** A second non-terminal outcome ends O-1 as UNFORMULABLE-WITH-DOCUMENTED-REASON unless the owner rules CLASS-SPLIT from the record (T3). |

Under every outcome: no v4 channel moves; no red gate is touched; GR2,
L0-1a/b/c, and the public paper are untouched. **HARD STOP** after the
verdict, pending owner ruling on the lines and O-1's terminal label.

## 6. Instrument contract

`calc/l01d_cycle_affinity.py`: pure stdlib. Instrument E uses exact
integers and `fractions`, on the integer matrices M = 10K built from
integers per §2 and never from floats. It imports `build_K` (for K_b) and `jacobi_eig`
(symmetric references and the symmetric data Gram only) unchanged. It
carries the RC-7-certified textual copy of `fit_residuals` + TAUS. RK4
runs exactly as in §2. It is deterministic, with no RNG, and runs once:
18 trajectories plus exact moment computations for 9 members. It
writes `L0_1D_RESULT.json` (sha-hashed) with `defect_history`. Runtime
is minutes. Scope: the §5 clause, nothing else.
