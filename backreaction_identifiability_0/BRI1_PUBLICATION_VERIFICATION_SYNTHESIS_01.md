## 2. Frozen scientific result

> For the frozen X1 finite reciprocal Duffing environment, the environmental force laws generated under different intervention protocols cannot all be represented by one shared causal signed-affine exogenous forcing process. A standardized third-cumulant/skewness witness distinguishes the intervention family for sufficiently large finite bath size. The distinguishing contribution scales asymptotically as O(1/N_B) and vanishes in the reservoir limit.

**Quantifiers preserved:** for each fixed sufficiently small t > 0, there exists finite N₀(t) such that for all N_B ≥ N₀(t), the standardized skewness witness is nonzero. No uniform statement over an interval. The numerically illustrated t* = 0.5 is not proven to lie inside the analytic δ interval.

---

## 3. Proof vs. illustration

**Analytic proof:** V1 establishes the theorem.

**V3 numerical illustration:** V3-R2 illustrates the finite-N behavior at preregistered finite times using deterministic quadrature. It is not part of the proof. The t* = 0.5 numerical result gives: negative standardized skewness; approximately 1/N_B scaling; P0 exact/null symmetry; correct Gibbs stationarity; consistency with the analytic structure. No interval certification for t* = 0.5 was added.

## 4. Numerical evidence summary (authoritative data only)

- P0 reference: ⟨x²⟩ = 0.467919916973665...
- Exact identity: ⟨x²⟩ + ⟨x⁴⟩ = 1
- At t* = 0.5: N_B=4, γ₁(F) = -5.338286160020776e-6; N_B=128, γ₁(F) = -1.668214424714962e-7
- Global fitted exponent: p ≈ 1.000000

## 5. V2 novelty ruling

**Known (do not claim novelty):** anharmonic/nonlinear environments can generate non-Gaussian forces; higher cumulants and finite-bath corrections are known; Gaussian/effective-harmonic reservoir recovery is known; location-scale noise models are established; standardized shape invariance under location-scale transformations is established; intervention-based identifiability is established in adjacent statistical literature; 1/N-type finite-size corrections are structurally expected.

**Surviving contribution:** the constructive physical/dynamical instantiation — an explicit reciprocal Hamiltonian environment is shown to leave a single shared causal location-scale/sign representation across an intervention family, with a shape-invariant witness and a quantified finite-size disappearance into the reservoir limit.

Positioned as: **KNOWN-RESULT-NEW-FRAMING**, not a fundamentally new mathematical theorem family.

---

## 6. Nearest literature firewall

No essentially equivalent shared-process non-representability result was found in the targeted audit. The paper must position explicitly against at least:

- causal location-scale noise model identifiability;
- interventional SDE identifiability;
- nonlinear/non-Gaussian GLE work;
- Makri harmonic/effective-bath and anharmonic-correction literature;
- finite-bath fluctuation-dissipation literature.

The audit was targeted, not exhaustive.

---

## 7. Publication contribution paragraph

> The verified contribution of BRI1-X1 is a constructive, quantified demonstration that a finite reciprocal anharmonic environment—a set of Duffing oscillators coupled to a driven degree of freedom—can generate environmental force laws across interventions that cannot all be represented by a single shared causal signed-affine exogenous process. The proof uses a standardized third-cumulant witness: for each fixed sufficiently small time \(t>0\), there exists a finite \(N_0(t)\) such that for every \(N_B\ge N_0(t)\), the driven protocol has a nonzero shape witness while the reference protocol has zero third cumulant exactly. The distinguishing signature is mesoscopic, scaling asymptotically as \(O(1/N_B)\) and vanishing in the reservoir limit, where the common Gaussian linear-response reservoir law is recovered. The theorem is analytic; deterministic finite-\(N_B\) numerics provide an evidence-grade illustration at preregistered finite times that are not claimed to lie inside the theorem's certified short-time interval. The result is positioned against known work on non-Gaussian bath forces, location-scale noise models, and interventional identifiability.
---

## 8. GRUT-independence gate (P6)

Would this result remain meaningful if GRUT disappeared? **Yes — P6 PASS.**

The theorem is formulated in ordinary classical Hamiltonian/open-system language. The model is a reciprocal Duffing bath. The result concerns stochastic representation/identifiability. No GRUT-specific primitive is required.

---

## 9. Claims permitted

- finite reciprocal anharmonic back-reaction can generate intervention-dependent reduced-force shape that cannot be removed by one shared causal affine modulation;
- for X1 the analytic shape witness is nonzero for sufficiently large finite N_B in the proven small-time regime;
- the witness decays asymptotically as O(1/N_B);
- the reservoir limit restores the common Gaussian/linear-response description;
- evidence-grade deterministic numerics illustrate the scaling at preregistered finite times.

## 10. Claims prohibited

- GRUT confirmed; new force; new quantum mechanics; primitive randomness; unique ontology; universal back-reaction identifiability; escape from universal causal exogenous representations; universal finite-bath theorem; experimentally observable threshold; certified finite-N threshold N0; certified numerical δ; external replication; human peer review; fundamentally new location-scale mathematics.

---

## 11. Verification failures (visible, not sanitized)

**Failed Monte Carlo:** the original preregistered MC visualization failed because the theorem's small-time signal was orders of magnitude below feasible sampling noise.

**Invalid R1:** the first deterministic quadrature implementation passed convergence tests but used an incorrect tensor/broadcasting structure. It was caught because the P0 Gibbs variance violated stationarity and an exact moment identity.

**R2 reporting failures:** the corrected physical computation survived, but cumulant columns were initially transcribed incorrectly; an incorrect Gibbs residual was reported; explanatory prose was written around a non-operative number; a commit message initially claimed changes absent from the pushed commit. These were repaired before final synthesis.

These are verification/governance findings.

---

## 12. Numerical governance rules earned from the campaign

**NG-1 — Independent invariant.** Every numerical illustration must include at least one exact or independently known control logically distinct from the primary witness. Odd-moment symmetry nulls alone are insufficient.

**NG-2 — Convergence ≠ correctness.** Resolution/step-size convergence demonstrates stability of the implemented calculation, not correctness of the implementation.

**NG-3 — Machine-readable provenance chain.** Publication-facing numerics follow: computation → authoritative machine-readable output → generated table/figure → prose interpretation. No manual transcription when generation is possible.

**NG-4 — Prose provenance.** Prose may interpret only values contained in authoritative machine-readable output or an explicitly labeled independent check.

**NG-5 — Remote completion verification.** A pushed task is complete only after remote verification confirms: claimed files are present; removed files/values are absent; remote tip matches local HEAD.

These rules are lessons earned by this campaign; they did not govern earlier work.

---

## 13. External-review status

- No external human peer review.
- No external independent laboratory replication.
- The independent numerical reproduction is another internal code path.
- The novelty audit was targeted, not exhaustive.

---

## 14. Publication readiness criteria P1–P6

**P1 — Is there a correct theorem? PASS.** V1 reproduced all eleven load-bearing steps independently or with standard theorems whose hypotheses were checked. No discrepancies.

**P2 — Was it independently reproduced? PASS.** Within the stated scope (independent internal re-derivation under a provenance firewall, not external replication). All steps reproduced.

**P3 — Is the nearest prior literature materially weaker/different? PASS.** The V2 audit found the closest physical-domain work (non-Gaussian GLE) lacks the shared-affine-competitor class, protocol family, theorem, and finite-size rate. The V2 supplement confirmed the distinction survives against causal location-scale models (static, not dynamical; parameter-identification, not non-representability).

**P4 — Can the novelty be explained in one paragraph without GRUT terminology? PASS.** The contribution paragraph (§7) stands without GRUT.

**P5 — Is there one clean figure making the theorem intuitive? PASS.** V3-R2 produced two figures from authoritative data showing 1/N_B scaling and the standardized-shape distinction.

**P6 — Would the result remain meaningful if GRUT disappeared? PASS.** The theorem is in standard classical Hamiltonian/open-system language; no GRUT-specific primitive is required.

## 15. Final terminal

# **BRI1-PUB-READY-WITH-POSITIONING**

**Why this terminal follows:** V1 stands (P1, P2 pass). V2 establishes the novelty positioning: the ingredients are known but the constructive dynamical instantiation with a shape-invariant witness and quantified finite-size disappearance is a genuine contribution that requires explicit positioning against known location-scale/interventional literature (P3 pass, with the caveat). P4 and P5 pass. P6 passes. No external human review exists — this is acknowledged and does not block the terminal, because the terminal describes readiness for drafting, not acceptance.

BRI1-PUB-READY would require novelty beyond KNOWN-RESULT-NEW-FRAMING; the V2 supplement showed the novelty is the framing/instantiation, not a new theorem family. BRI1-PUB-OPEN would require an unresolved criterion; all six are resolved.

---

## 16. What the terminal means operationally

> The result is ready to be drafted as a bounded research manuscript provided its known ingredients and adjacent location-scale/interventional literature are explicitly credited and the surviving contribution is framed as the constructive dynamical/physical instantiation.

It does NOT mean: accepted; peer-reviewed; experimentally confirmed; revolutionary; GRUT confirmed.

## 17. Next-step recommendation

The synthesis recommends, in order:

1. Manuscript architecture (section plan, theorem statement placement, figure selection).
2. Title/abstract development.
3. Final targeted literature sweep (particularly the causal location-scale and interventional SDE literatures, to ensure no missed comparator).
4. External expert review (optional but recommended before submission).
