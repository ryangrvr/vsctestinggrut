"""mz_inheritance: does the projected memory kernel inherit the Matsubara ladder?

THE QUESTION, as posed by the owner on 2026-08-19 and recorded in rung3_single_pole's tier_note:

    KMS ties N to Im K_R, so N inherits coth's poles UNLESS Im K_R has zeros at the Matsubara
    frequencies that cancel them. That cancellation is the only route by which the projected
    kernel could fail to inherit the ladder.

THE ANSWER IS NOT A YES OR A NO. It is that the question has TWO answers, and which one applies is
fixed by a convention rung3's statement never makes:

  (1) THE ESCAPE THE OWNER NAMED DOES NOT OPERATE. The framework's own J has no zeros on the
      imaginary axis -- J(i v) = eta (i v)^3 exp(+(v/w_c)^2) is nonzero for every v -- so nothing
      cancels coth's poles. On the SYMMETRISED route the ladder is inherited, exactly as framed.

  (2) BUT THE SYMMETRISED ROUTE IS NOT THE ONLY ONE, AND THE OTHER STANDARD CHOICE HAS NO LADDER
      AT ALL. Mori-Zwanzig projection for a quantum system conventionally uses the KUBO-MORI
      (canonical) inner product, and the Kubo correlation function carries

            C_K(w) = 2 chi''(w) / (beta w)          NOT      C_S(w) = chi''(w) coth(beta w / 2).

      The coth is REPLACED by 2/(beta w). Every Matsubara pole is gone; what is left is a single
      pole at w = 0. Derived here from the definition, not quoted.

  (3) AND THE GENERALISED-LANGEVIN FRICTION KERNEL IS TEMPERATURE-INDEPENDENT OUTRIGHT:
      gamma(t) ~ int (J(w)/w) cos(w t) dw carries no coth, so it cannot carry the ladder. Its
      decay rate is set by the cutoff and does not move when T moves -- checked numerically at two
      temperatures, against nu(t) which does move.

SO: rung3's phrase "the Mori-Zwanzig kernel" does not currently denote a unique object, and the
two objects it could denote answer this question OPPOSITELY. That is a defect in the node's
STATEMENT rather than in its physics, it is cheap to repair, and it must be repaired before the
ladder can be said to bear on the conjecture at all.

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE ADVERSE FILING OF 2026-08-19: that filing said the ladder is adverse to
rung3 and that inheritance was the open step. The first half stands for the symmetrised noise
kernel and is now sharpened -- the escape route is closed. The second half is answered in a way
that WEAKENS the adverse reading: on the conventional MZ inner product there is no ladder to
inherit. The adverse conclusion is therefore CONDITIONAL on a reading of rung3 that rung3 does not
state, and this file says so rather than leaving the stronger version standing.

    """RETRACTED AND REPLACED, 2026-08-19, on the owner's counterexample.

    THE FIRST VERSION scanned J = eta w^s exp(-(w/w_c)^2) for s = 1,2,3,5, found J(i v) != 0 every
    time, and concluded "the escape the owner named is closed for this J". Every evaluation was
    correct and the conclusion does not follow: THE LOOP VARIED THE EXPONENT AND HELD THE
    FUNCTIONAL FORM FIXED, and the form is the only thing that matters. A positive power times a
    nowhere-vanishing entire factor cannot have zeros off the origin -- true BY CONSTRUCTION OF
    THE FAMILY, not as a fact about de Sitter.

    AND IT IS THE SAME FAILURE THIS FILE DIAGNOSES TWO PARTS LATER. PART 3b convicts the June
    analyticity argument of checking omega = 0 -- the one point where cancellation was possible --
    and concluding about the rungs. PART 1 checked a family where cancellation was IMPOSSIBLE by
    construction and concluded about the general case. Both are sampling-region failures; they
    point in opposite directions; and the second was written into this file by the same hand that
    wrote the first up as a lesson, in the same file, in the same wave.

    THE COUNTEREXAMPLE, in this file's own idiom, cutoff and all:

        A(w) = eta w^2 tanh(pi w / H) exp(-(w/w_c)^2)

    odd, positive for w > 0 (so passive / Herglotz-admissible on the line), Gaussian cutoff intact,
    A -> pi eta w^3 / H in the infrared (super-Ohmic s = 3, exactly what is booked), and -- since
    beta = 2 pi / H -- coth(beta w/2) A(w) = eta w^2 exp(-(w/w_c)^2), ENTIRE. Every Matsubara pole
    is gone. An admissible spectral function executes the escape completely.

    THE UNDECLARED ASSUMPTION, now declared: power-law-times-cutoff is the FLAT-SPACE thermal-bath
    idiom, where T is an external parameter and nothing would produce a tanh(beta w/2) factor. In
    de Sitter T = H/2pi and the dynamics both descend from H, so A is a function of w/H and the
    reflection formula Gamma(z)Gamma(1-z) = pi/sin(pi z) generates exactly sinh/cosh structure in
    pi w / H. The escape is not exotic here. Whether it is REALISED is PART 1b's question."""

def part1b_is_the_escape_REALISED_at_free_level():
    """THE DECISIVE EVALUATION, done from this repository's own exact c = 0 solution rather than
    from a Gamma-ratio taken on report.

    G_R(x,x') = psi_reg(x_<) u_+(x_>) / W, and A(w) = [G_R(w) - G_R(-w)]/2i is the analytic
    continuation of Im G_R. Three facts, each checked numerically below, collapse it:
        u_+(-w) = u_-(w) exactly;  psi_reg (canonically ~ x^{l+1}) is EVEN in w;
        W[psi_reg, u_+] = -(2l+1), independent of w.
    Hence A(w) is proportional to u_+ - u_- = N(w) psi_reg, and A's w-zeros ARE N's:

        N(w) = 2 i w prod_{j=1..l} (w^2 + j^2 H^2) / c_l

    SO THE FREE SPECTRAL FUNCTION VANISHES AT THE FIRST l RUNGS AND AT NO OTHERS. The escape needs
    zeros at EVERY rung. At fixed l it gets exactly l of them, and is NONZERO at every n > l.
    Summing over l with its (2l+1) degeneracy does not help: at rung n the terms with l >= n
    vanish and the terms with l < n do not, so the total is nonzero at every rung.

    THE ANSWER IS THEREFORE: PARTIALLY, AND NOT ENOUGH. The mechanism the owner identified is
    real -- the geometry does put spectral zeros on the Matsubara ladder, at spacing exactly H --
    but it truncates at l. Note the SAME finite set already appeared in an independent object:
    calc/static_patch_tt_response.py PART 3c's Blaschke amplitude has zeros at w = -i j H for
    j = 1..l. Two different objects, one truncated ladder.

    WHAT THIS DOES TO rung3: the escape has no free-level realisation, so it would require the
    interacting Sigma to manufacture zeros at every n > l where the free theory has none. That is
    a much heavier lift than preserving zeros that are already there, and it is the outcome
    adverse to single-pole."""

def part1c_the_panel_corrections():
    """FOUR CORRECTIONS from the adversarial pass of 2026-08-19. All four lenses returned
    refuted=False -- the adverse conclusion survives -- and all four found something wrong with
    how it was stated. Two run FAVOURABLE to the framework, one is a real gap in my reasoning, and
    the fourth relocates the cause of the favourable half entirely.

    (1) THE ZERO SET WAS UNDER-COUNTED, favourably. N ~ w prod_{j=1..l}(w^2 + j^2) carries an
        overall w, so it vanishes at w = 0 and at the NEGATIVE rungs too: exactly 2l+1 zeros,
        |n| <= l. So l+1 NON-NEGATIVE rungs cancel (n = 0..l), not l.

    (2) "A IS PROPORTIONAL TO N" IS FALSE AS WRITTEN -- reported independently by two lenses, and
        it is a genuine gap rather than a wrong number. The identity is
            A(w) = N(w) psi_reg(x_<;w) psi_reg(x_>;w) / (2i W)
        and that prefactor is entire of order 1, so it has INFINITELY MANY zeros -- located for
        l=2 at x=0.9 near w = 6.2564, 10.0118, 13.6229, ... and at x=2.0 near 2.6137, 4.3734, ...,
        a different set spaced ~pi/x. So A at fixed (x,x') vanishes at infinitely many w that are
        NOT rungs, and "at no others" is true of N and FALSE of A.
        THE RUNG CONCLUSION SURVIVES, but only via an argument that was not in my claim: on the
        imaginary axis w = i kappa the equation is psi'' = (kappa^2 + V) psi with V > 0, so
        psi_reg leaves the origin positive and stays positive -- no zeros there, so the prefactor
        adds no rung zeros. I asserted about A what I had proved about N.

    (3) THE ADVERSE CONCLUSION IS STRONGER THAN I STATED. At FIXED l the surviving rungs are the
        whole infinite tower n = l+1, l+2, ... So there is no single relaxation rate even at fixed
        multipole, before any sum over l. My phrasing implied the multiplicity came from summing
        over multipoles; it does not need to.

    (4) AND THE FAVOURABLE HALF IS KINEMATIC, NOT GEOMETRIC -- the most consequential correction.
        There is an exact sum rule, verified below to 26+ digits:

            sum_{l>=0} (2l+1) A_l(x,x;w)  =  -w sinh^2(x)

        The entire prod(w^2 + j^2) structure CANCELS IDENTICALLY when the multipoles are summed
        with their natural (2l+1) degeneracy. The l-summed local spectral density is exactly
        OHMIC and has NO Matsubara-rung zeros at all. So the ladder zeros are a PARTIAL-WAVE
        THRESHOLD FACTOR -- the de Sitter splitting of the flat-space order-(2l+1) centrifugal
        zero at w = 0 -- not a property of the physical local response. They survive into the
        graviton bath SOLELY BECAUSE l = 0 and l = 1 TENSOR HARMONICS DO NOT EXIST.
        So "the geometry genuinely kills the two slowest rungs" is wrong as filed: TWO MISSING
        PARTIAL WAVES kill them, and de Sitter does nothing. The effect is real and its cause is
        kinematic accident, which is a much weaker thing to book.

    AND ONE NEAR-MISS OF MY OWN, recorded because it nearly went the other way: my first attempt
    to check the sum rule summed to l = 80 at 30 digits and returned 1e16 instead of 1. I was one
    step from reporting "could not reproduce" against a correct result -- the failure was my own
    precision (the downward recursion and the double factorials lose everything at that l), not
    the rule."""

        "finite-T CONFIRMED ... via ANALYTICITY: the coth 1/omega is exactly cancelled by one of
         the three powers of omega in J~omega^3, so S(omega)=a*omega^2+b*omega^4+... is analytic
         at omega=0 (no 1/omega, no branch point, no log) -> NO second slow pole. ... memory stays
         cutoff-set (tau_c~1/omega_c). Single-pole holds at finite T."

    THE POSITIVE HALF IS CORRECT AND IS RE-VERIFIED HERE. With J ~ omega^3 the coth's 1/omega does
    cancel and S is analytic at the origin.

    THE NEGATIVE HALF DOES NOT FOLLOW. "Analytic at omega = 0" is a statement about ONE POINT.
    coth's poles are at omega = 2 pi i n / beta for every n != 0, and J does not vanish at any of
    them, so every one survives. The argument checked the only pole J CAN cancel and concluded
    about the ones it cannot.

    This also settles the convention question PART 2 raised: the object this check is performed on
    is S(omega) = J(omega) coth(beta omega / 2), the SYMMETRISED noise spectrum. So rung3's own
    finite-T history identifies its kernel, and the adverse reading is NOT conditional on a
    convention the node never states -- the node states it here. The narrowing in PART 4 is
    therefore itself narrowed, in the direction that costs the framework."""
