"""static_patch_tt_response: the analytic structure of the retarded response on the de Sitter
STATIC PATCH, computed rather than cited.

PRE-REGISTERED: provenance/prereg/PREREG_FRAME_MIGRATION_2026-08-18.txt (v1, sealed 2026-08-18,
sha256 = 7b7ffaaa185a49e4...) and its disclosure-only supersession

Both were sealed BEFORE this file existed. X3 of that pre-registration voids it for any
static-patch computation of the TT response run before sealing; a repository-wide search for such
a computation found none, and the public document records the same fact in its own words ("the
free static-patch tower is published and closed-form ... It has not been computed").

A NOTE ON A COLLIDING NAME, because this program has now had five of them. `kk_static_transfer.py`
is about the STATIC MODULUS -- the omega -> 0 limit of a response function. It is not about the
de Sitter static PATCH and shares no object with this file. Prior collisions: TT, kappa, tau_0, S1.

WHAT IS ESTABLISHED HERE, and at what strength:

  (A) DERIVED, EXACT. On the static patch, for the one-parameter family of radial master equations
      f d/dr (f dpsi/dr) + (omega^2 - V) psi = 0,   V = f(r) * ( l(l+1)/r^2 + c H^2 ),
      f(r) = 1 - H^2 r^2, the retarded/quasinormal frequencies are
          omega_{n,l} / H  =  -i [ l + 2n + (3 -/+ sqrt(1-4c))/2 ],    n = 0,1,2,...
      PURELY IMAGINARY, DISCRETE, and spaced by exactly 2H in the overtone index -- for EVERY c.
      Exhibited, not asserted: at each such frequency the hypergeometric series truncates to a
      POLYNOMIAL, so the mode function is elementary, satisfies the ODE with residual exactly zero
      (symbolically checked), is regular at the origin by inspection, and is purely OUTGOING at the
      horizon by inspection -- there is no ingoing admixture to bound numerically.

  (B) DERIVED. c = -2 is the massless minimally coupled scalar: the potential is computed here
      from the metric, not quoted.

  (C) DERIVED IN-HOUSE 2026-08-19, PART 1b -- this was flagged as an open gap and is now closed.
      Linearising R_mn = Lambda g_mn about the static patch with an odd-parity Regge-Wheeler
      ansatz, at EXPLICIT l (which is what made it finish where two abstract-l attempts did not),
      gives V = f(r) l(l+1)/r^2: c = 0 EXACTLY, and NOT the c = -2 massless-scalar member. So the
      exhibit is about the graviton's own potential. SCOPE: axial sector; the polar sector is
      reported elsewhere to share the master equation and is not verified here.

  (A-RETRACTED, 2026-08-19) PART 3b RETRACTS the claim that the frequencies in (A) are
      quasinormal. The boundary-condition check tested the wrong thing. Read PART 3b before
      anything else in this file; every downstream part is now marked conditional.

  (D) THE CONSEQUENCE FOR THE SINGLE-POLE CONJECTURE, stated at the weaker of two strengths.
      A single-pole (Debye/Markovian) kernel has ONE pole. This object has infinitely many, and
      -- the point that decides it -- THERE IS NO PARAMETER SEPARATING THE LEADING POLE FROM THE
      REST. Gap and spacing are both O(H); their ratio is O(1) and contains no small quantity.
      A single dominant pole can be reached only by WAITING (the tower's contributions separate as
      exp(-2Ht)), never by a parametric limit. "Parametrically suppressed" and "eventually
      negligible" are different claims, and only the second is available here.

    """THE GRAVITON'S c, DERIVED IN-HOUSE. This closes the gap flagged as (C) above.

    Two earlier attempts failed on HARDWARE, not on physics: both carried an abstract P(theta) with
    a Legendre substitution, and sympy would not finish. Fixing l and using the explicit Legendre
    polynomial makes every angular object concrete trig and the linearisation takes seconds.

    METHOD, and it is a derivation rather than a citation: linearise the vacuum equation
    R_mn = Lambda g_mn (Lambda = 3H^2, checked in PART 0) about the static patch with an
    odd-parity Regge-Wheeler ansatz h_{t phi} = h0(r) e^{-i w t} S(theta),
    h_{r phi} = h1(r) e^{-i w t} S(theta), S = sin(theta) d_theta P_l(cos theta); expand the FULL
    Ricci tensor in eps and take the O(eps) part. Two independent equations survive:

        E_{theta phi}:  -i w h0 = f d/dr ( f h1 )          [l-INDEPENDENT]
        E_{r phi}:      -(l(l+1) - 2) f h1 + w^2 r^2 h1 - i w r^2 h0' + 2 i w r h0 = 0

    The l(l+1)-2 coefficient is read off two explicit runs: it is 4 at l=2 and 10 at l=3.

    Substituting h0 and setting Z = f h1 / r gives A2 Z'' + A1 Z' + A0 Z with A1/(A2/f^2) EXACTLY
    f f' -- no stray first-derivative term, which is what makes Z the master variable rather than
    a convenient rescaling -- and

        V = f(r) * l(l+1) / r^2,    i.e.  c = 0 EXACTLY.

    SO THE EXHIBIT IS ABOUT THE GRAVITON'S POTENTIAL. The c = 0 family analysed in PARTS 3b/3c is
    the one the framework's own object lives in, and the pole-free result is about it.

    SCOPE, STATED: this is the AXIAL (odd-parity) sector. An independent derivation in the same
    wave reported that the polar (even-parity) sector shares the same master equation; that is NOT
    verified here and is taken as unconfirmed."""

    PART 3 originally reported that each exhibited mode is "purely outgoing at the horizon by
    inspection", on the argument that psi = r^{l+1} (1-r^2)^{-i w/2} x (polynomial) is the peeled
    outgoing factor times something analytic and non-zero at r = 1.  THAT ARGUMENT IS FALSE, and
    the error was visible in this file's own PART 2 output: gamma - alpha - beta = i*w, so the
    ingoing connection coefficient carries Gamma(-i*w), which has a POLE exactly when i*w is a
    positive integer -- which is exactly where the quantisation condition 1/Gamma(alpha) = 0 puts
    these modes.  0 x infinity.  It was noticed, called "need care", and then not carried through.

    Concretely: (1-r^2)^{-i w/2} = cosh(x)^{i w} in the tortoise coordinate, and
        cosh(x)^{i w} = (e^x/2)^{i w} (1 + e^{-2x})^{i w},
    whose binomial series contributes e^{i w x} e^{-2 n x}.  When i*w is a positive integer, one of
    those terms IS e^{-i w x}.  The peeled factor is not purely outgoing at precisely the claimed
    frequencies.

    The counterexample is elementary and is computed below: for the c = 0 family the exact Jost
    pair is u_+- = e^{+-i w x} Q_l(coth x) with Q_l MONIC of degree l, so BOTH behave as x^{-l} at
    the origin, and the regular solution is therefore u_+ - u_- -- giving ingoing amplitude
    B = -A for EVERY omega.  B never vanishes, so these are not quasinormal modes and nothing in

    is MEROMORPHIC: its only singularities are the poles above.
