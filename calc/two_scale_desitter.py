"""TWO-SCALE VACUUM: is the IR relaxation scale tau2 ~ 1/H forced by the de Sitter horizon,
or inserted by hand?

GRUT's evolving-w(z) story (rung 7) needs a second, slow relaxation scale tau2 ~ 1/H0 -- the
same 'second bath scale' that conditions single-pole (rung 3). We asserted it was
'horizon-motivated'. This tests that, using Starobinsky-Yokoyama stochastic inflation, where a
light scalar in de Sitter obeys a Langevin equation whose noise IS the horizon (Gibbons-Hawking)
scale:

    dphi/dt = -V'(phi)/(3H) + (H/2pi) eta(t),   <eta(t)eta(t')> = delta(t-t')

The diffusion constant is D = (1/2)(H/2pi)^2 = H^2/(8 pi^2): the fluctuation amplitude is set by
the horizon. So the EXISTENCE of a horizon-driven relaxation is intrinsic to de Sitter -- not
inserted. The question is the TIMESCALE.

For the first two moments the Langevin equation closes exactly (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck for V=m^2 phi^2/2):
    d<phi>/dt   = -(m^2/3H) <phi>
    d<phi^2>/dt = -2(m^2/3H) <phi^2> + 2D
=> mean relaxes at rate m^2/3H, so  tau_relax = 3H/m^2,  and  <phi^2>_eq = 2D/(2 m^2/3H) = 3H^4/(8 pi^2 m^2).
We integrate these moment ODEs deterministically (no randomness) and read off the relaxation time.

Units: H = 1.  tau is then in units of the Hubble time 1/H.  Pure stdlib.

  CONDITIONAL. Decompose, as with the arrow (existence vs scale):
   * The horizon FORCES the NOISE (H/2pi) and the EXISTENCE of a stochastic relaxation toward the
     Starobinsky-Yokoyama equilibrium. That part is intrinsic to de Sitter -- not a patch.
   * The relaxation TIMESCALE tau2:
       - FREE IR mode: tau ~ 3H/m^2; tau ~ 1/H0 today needs m ~ H0 -- the standard quintessence
         coincidence/tuning. INSERTED.
       - SELF-INTERACTING O(1) IR mode: de Sitter IR generates m_eff ~ sqrt(lambda) H, which
         TRACKS H, so tau ~ 1/H at all epochs. FORCED by the horizon (no 'why now' coincidence).
  So tau2 ~ 1/H is horizon-FORCED *iff* GRUT's IR vacuum mode is a light, O(1)-self-coupled scalar
  (dynamical-mass tracking), and INSERTED/tuned if it is a free field.

  WHAT THE 'NATURAL' ROUTE STILL ASSUMES (mark, do not launder):
   (i)  the existence of a light scalar IR mode in the vacuum;
   (ii) an O(1) self-coupling lambda for it.
  These are real inputs. The horizon supplies the noise and the tracking; it does not supply the
  mode or its coupling for free.

  CANDIDATE INTERNAL CONNECTION (hypothesis, not established): the conformalon -- the contested
  dynamical conformal mode of the trace-anomaly / rung-9 alpha leg -- is exactly a self-interacting
  conformal scalar that could be this IR mode, tying rung 9 (alpha de-anchor) to rung 7 (w(z)
  two-scale). If so, the same mode that threatens the alpha anchor would SUPPLY the cosmological
  relaxation. To be checked, not claimed.

  ONE-LINE QUESTION FOR THE SPECIALIST:
    'For a light O(1)-self-coupled scalar in de Sitter, does the dynamically generated mass
     m_eff ~ sqrt(lambda) H track H closely enough across the matter->dark-energy transition that
     the relaxation time stays ~ 1/H (making evolving w(z) generic), or does the tracking fail
     once H is not constant (restoring a coincidence)?'""")
