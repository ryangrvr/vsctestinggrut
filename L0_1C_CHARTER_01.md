# L0-1c — LINEARITY (D-LIN): CHARTER + PRE-REGISTRATION (frozen before evaluation)

**Fork:** L0-1c, the third fork of the Level-0 necessity sweep.
**Authority:** `L0_1B_OWNER_RULING_01.md` (D-LIN authorized next per
the frozen descent order; the pin-free locality fork queued separate,
not interrupting); design basis `L0_1_NECESSITY_SWEEP_DESIGN_01.md` §4
D-LIN and §2 (the predicate registry: P_exact-reduction ≠
P_emergence). The owner's four prohibitions bind.

**Pre-freeze review provenance.** A draft of this charter (commit
`ab9108a`, banner-marked, execution blocked) underwent an adversarial
pre-freeze design review — four lenses, every finding adversarially
verified — recorded in `L0_1C_PREFREEZE_REVIEW_01.md`. All confirmed
findings are incorporated below and the material ones are disclosed
in §3. In verifying feasibility, the review **numerically exercised
the frozen schedule and previewed gate-relevant magnitudes** (the
X-1 deficits, the minimum gated response, the hardest leg's comparator
grade). Per the review's own discipline ruling, this frozen text
carries **analytic derivations and bands only**; the measured preview
values are quarantined to the review record and adjudicate nothing.
Consequence, stated before the run: the previewed gates are
**certification-grade** for this fork — the verdict must grade them as
disclosed-foreknowledge certifications, never as discoveries. The
genuinely unpreviewed live content is named in §3.5.

## 0. The frozen question, the frozen hypothesis, and the two named outcomes

> **Is linearity necessary for the phenomena, or only for the
> instrument?**

**H3 (frozen in the design, under attack here, not protection):**
linearity certifies for P_exact-reduction and does **not** certify for
P_memory / P_positivity, once the phenomenon batteries are
instrument-separated per the registry.

- **Outcome A (phenomenon failure, per-property):** an adjudicating
  leg of a deleted member loses the declared decay grade, monotone
  decrease, or the trajectory-Gram positivity reading on the gated
  window — recorded per property and per failing (β, a) set, never as
  a composed "the phenomena"; H3 is thereby falsified at the fork's
  full declared scope (§5). Outcome A is live in this fork through
  the gates §3 marks attackable — not through sign breaches, which
  §3.2's theorem forecloses.
- **Outcome B (the instrument split, the H3 target):** the
  eigen-reduction dies exactly where its defining premise
  (superposition) dies, while the phenomena survive — *linearity
  belongs to the instrument, not to the tested response phenomena
  (P_memory; P_positivity as operationalized)* — under the §3.4
  transient-limited qualifier, with P_continuum and P_geometry
  visibly unclaimed (untested by this fork).

**The deletion touches linearity ONLY.** Every member keeps the pin
(0.3), the chain couplings (+1), and a convex potential, so
∇²V(0) = K_b **exactly, for every β** — the spectral gap at the
unique fixed point and passivity (V bounded below, strictly convex)
are held by construction. β < 0 (softening) would conflate the
linearity deletion with a passivity deletion and is **out of scope**
(noted; it belongs to a future conflated-deletion fork if ever
chartered — where §3.2's sign identity would NOT hold).

## 1. Members, legs, and the probe (frozen; N = 24; the C1-a bath block)

Substrate: the committed anchor stiffness `build_K(24, 0)` (pin 0.3,
unit chain springs); **bath block** K_b = its (1:, 1:) block
(dimension 23). Potential and dynamics:

> V(x) = ½ xᵀ K_b x + β Σᵢ xᵢ⁴  ·  **ẋ = −∇V(x) = −K_b x − 4β x³**
> (componentwise cube)

The first-order gradient-flow convention **is the record's kernel
convention**: at β = 0 it reproduces the sealed kernel
k(τ) = Σu²e^{−λτ} = e₁ᵀe^{−K_b τ}e₁ identically, and the β > 0
normalized response is this convention's kernel object by the same
declaration. Second-order (Newtonian) dynamics are a different fork,
out of scope, noted.

**Vocabulary (frozen; resolves the draft's collision):** a **member**
is a β value; a **leg** is a (β, a) pair.

- **Members:** β ∈ {0 (anchor), 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0} — five
  deleted members plus the anchor.
- **Probe amplitudes:** x(0) = a·e₁ with a ∈ {0.001, 1.0, 3.0} —
  **18 legs**. The **normalized response** r(τ; a, β) = x₁(τ)/a is
  the kernel object: at β = 0, r ≡ k for every a (linearity); for
  β > 0 its a-dependence *is* the deletion made visible.
- **Leg roles (frozen):** the three β = 0 legs are **replication
  legs** (sealed-known); the a = 0.001 legs of deleted members are
  **linear-regime control legs**; the a ∈ {1.0, 3.0} legs of deleted
  members are the **adjudicating legs** (10 of them); the **strong
  legs** are (β = 1, a = 3) and (β = 3, a = 3). Only adjudicating
  legs can carry Outcome A (§5); replication and control legs are
  identity-protected — an M-battery failure there is HALT, never
  physics.

## 2. The two instruments, the batteries, the grids, the integrator (frozen)

**Instrument A — the eigen-reduction (P_exact-reduction).** The
committed eigen machinery (`jacobi_eig`, the eigen-form kernel). Its
defining premise is superposition: r independent of a. Instrument A's
verdict is **definitional and stated as such** (§3.1): X-1
*instantiates numerically* that the premise fails on the deleted
members; it discovers nothing.

**Instrument B — the phenomenon battery (P_memory, P_positivity;
substrate-eigen-free).** Direct time-domain integration of the
gradient flow. No eigendecomposition of the substrate enters
Instrument B; the eigen-form appears only as RC-1/RC-6's sealed
reference. (M-3 applies `jacobi_eig` to a **data** Gram matrix built
from the recorded trajectory — instrument mathematics on measured
values, presupposing nothing about the dynamics that produced them.)

- **P_memory battery:** the L0-1a grade comparator, carried as a
  **textual copy** of `fit_residuals` together with its TAUS grid
  (the carrying mechanism the draft lacked), certified against the
  sealed record by RC-6 before any deletion is read. Grade per leg on
  the gated window; never a threshold on a single number.
- **P_positivity battery (the registry substitution, disclosed —
  §3.3):** (i) monotone decrease of r on the gated window (M-2);
  (ii) the **trajectory-Gram PSD reading** (M-3): the record's
  operationalization J(w) ≥ 0 is, by Bernstein, complete monotonicity
  of the kernel, whose declared-grid form is positive
  semidefiniteness of G_ij = r(τ_i + τ_j) on the frozen sub-grid
  τ_i ∈ {1.0, 1.5, …, 20.0} (39 points; every sum τ_i + τ_j lands on
  the gated grid ≤ 40). Nonnegativity of r itself is identity-held
  (§3.2) and lives in RC-5, not in the battery.

**Grids (frozen; all ungated grids diagnostic-only).** Gated window:
τ ∈ [1, 40] step 0.5 (79 points — the registry's declared P_memory
window, carried from L0-1a/b). Early diagnostic grid: τ ∈ [0.05,
0.95] step 0.05 (19 points). Early-early diagnostic grid:
τ ∈ {0.0005, 0.001, 0.002, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.045} — anchored about
a decade below the strongest member's collapse timescale, so the
deletion-specific collapse is actually mapped (most of the amplitude
action precedes τ = 0.05, while the nonlinear-dominant regime itself
extends to τ ~ 0.25–0.5 inside the existing grids).

**Integrator (frozen; the mechanism is mandated, not just the
schedule).** Classical RK4, two-phase fixed steps h₁ = 10⁻⁴ on
[0, 1], h₂ = 2.5×10⁻³ on (1, 40]. The integrator advances by integer
step counts (10000 steps of h₁, then 15600 steps of h₂); recordings
trigger at step indices, never at accumulated-time tests —
early-early grid at h₁ steps {5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 450}, early
grid at every 500th h₁ step (j = 1…19), gated grid at h₁ step 10000
and then every 200th h₂ step (i = 1…78); the halved-schedule audit
(h₁/2, h₂/2) switches phase at step 20000 and records the gated grid
at that step and every 400th h₂/2 step thereafter (early grid at
every 1000th h₁/2 step); τ labels are taken from the nominal grid
lists and τ is never accumulated in floating point.

**Trajectory inventory (frozen): 38.** The 18 legs; a
halved-schedule audit of every leg (RC-2 is per-leg); and two
**linear-continuation runs** (X-diag): from each strong leg's
recorded full-precision state x(τ = 1), integrate the pure linear
flow ẋ = −K_b x on (1, 40] under the identical h₂ stepping —
diagnostic-only, no halved audit, RC-3 with the quadratic V.

## 3. Honesty note, stated before the run (incorporating the verified review)

1. **Definitional content:** the P_exact-reduction line. "The
   eigen-reduction requires linearity" is true by what the reduction
   *is*; X-1 measures the premise's failure, it does not test a
   hypothesis. Recorded with this status on its face.
2. **The sign identity (theorem; forecloses one Outcome A branch).**
   The flow is cooperative: the Jacobian's off-diagonal entries are
   −(K_b)_ij = +w_ij ≥ 0 (Kamke condition; the −4βx³ term is
   diagonal), the vector field on each face xᵢ = 0 points inward
   (ẋᵢ = Σⱼ wᵢⱼxⱼ ≥ 0), and V is coercive with global solutions — so
   the nonnegative orthant is forward-invariant from x(0) = a·e₁,
   and Grönwall on ẋ₁ ≥ −(K₁₁ + 4βx₁²)x₁ gives **x₁(t) > 0 strictly,
   for every leg**. Scope conditions, stated so the identity is never
   over-generalized: off-diagonals of K_b nonpositive (cooperativity),
   β ≥ 0, x(0) = a·e₁ with a > 0 — all three fail in other forks
   (e.g. the fenced β < 0 fork). Consequence: **a recorded r ≤ 0
   anywhere, on any grid, at any leg, is an integrator artifact —
   HALT (RC-5), never adjudicating.** The nonnegativity half of the
   positivity battery is therefore identity-held; only monotone
   decrease and the Gram reading are tested.
3. **The registry substitution, disclosed (the draft's silent
   weakening, corrected):** the substrate-spectral construction of
   J(w) is Instrument-A-definitional and dies with the
   eigen-reduction; the *property* has the exact eigen-free reading
   of §2 (Bernstein/Gram), which M-3 gates. The §5 positivity line is
   scoped to this operationalization on its face — never
   UNFORMULABLE-YET (the battery is formulable, and a false entry
   would corrupt the formulability floor the D-ORD/D-HERM/D-DET queue
   keys on).
4. **The deletion is transient-limited on the declared window
   (analytic; the structural cap).** With the 0.3 pin on every site,
   at any maximizer of m(t) = maxᵢ xᵢ(t) the linear part contributes
   ≤ −0.3m, so D⁺m ≤ −4βm³ and hence x₁(t)² ≤ m(t)² ≤ 1/(8βt) for
   every β > 0 member and every amplitude. The cap is **uniform in β
   and a**: by the gated window the nonlinear stiffness 12βx₁² sits
   below λ_min at every leg. In-class re-chartering can push the
   amplitude-collapse defect toward 1 but can **never** produce
   in-window-dominant nonlinearity; a future fork seeking that
   stronger deletion sense must name a structurally different
   deletion (nonlinearity in the couplings, or a convex
   non-self-limiting potential). Outcome B, if it lands, carries this
   qualifier on its face.
5. **Classification of the live content (the review's central
   product).** *Certification-grade (previewed or analytically
   banded):* X-1 — its direction is forced on the orthant (r ≤ k by
   comparison with the linear flow; r nonincreasing in a by
   subhomogeneity, both resting on cooperativity + forward-invariance,
   and making X-1's |·| one-sided at the declared legs), its
   magnitude sits in an analytic band ≈ 0.6–0.85 against the frozen
   0.1 margin, and its persistence is forced — the burned slow-mode
   amplitude accumulates monotonically, so an early-dying transient
   *freezes* the deficit at the loss factor rather than erasing it.
   (The `ab9108a` draft carried the opposite mechanism — "could fail
   if the transient dies before τ = 1" — which is backwards; recorded
   here per the disclosure obligation.) Likewise M-1 at replication
   and control legs (sealed-known / linear-regime). *Analytic-leaning:*
   M-1 at adjudicating legs — the transient is exhausted before the
   window opens even at the strongest leg (its own x₁ ≳ 0.3
   criterion puts the crossover near t ≈ 0.26), so what the
   window-global fit actually sees is the transient-deformed launch
   state, early-window higher-mode content, and an envelope-derived
   in-window distortion budget of ≲ 0.2 nats against the sealed
   comparator's multi-nat discriminant (R_alg − R_exp ≈ 2.8 on the
   anchor), drifting in the passing direction — never in-window
   nonlinear dominance, which §3.4 caps; M-2 at adjudicating legs —
   the exact algebra of a rebound is frozen here so its status is
   auditable: row 1 of K_b gives ẋ₁ = −2.3x₁ − 4βx₁³ + x₂, so x₁
   rises iff x₂ > 2.3x₁ + 4βx₁³; asymptotically the state aligns
   with the slow mode, whose exact eigen-row identity
   2.3 − φ₂/φ₁ = λ_min (φ₂/φ₁ ≈ 1.9955 < 2.3) forces eventual strict
   decrease — but nothing forces it on the finite window from a
   transient-deformed state, which is the genuinely open part. The
   β = 0 legs are identity-grade for both M-2 and M-3 (the sealed
   kernel is exactly completely monotone). *Genuinely unpreviewed:* **M-3, the trajectory-Gram PSD
   gate — no identity forces near-complete-monotonicity of the
   nonlinear response, and no preview touched the Gram spectrum; this
   is the fork's sharpest live content** — plus the D_act activation
   map, the early-early collapse map, and the M-diag fine structure.
6. **Diagnostic honesty (two corrections carried from the review):**
   (i) X-1's margin is carried overwhelmingly by pre-window
   depletion; in-window deletion activity is measured by D_act (§4
   X-diag), recorded ungated per the design's magnitudes-reported
   rule, and both NOT-LOAD-BEARING lines are scoped to a deletion
   whose in-window action is at the recorded D_act level. (ii) The
   late-slope M-diag compares each leg against the **anchor leg's own
   fitted window-tail slope**, not against λ_min = 0.304, which is
   asymptotic-only — the window tail reads a mode-mixture value above
   it for every leg including β = 0, and misreading that as a
   deletion effect is the exact artifact this line forecloses.

## 4. The gates (frozen, mechanical)

**Controls and identities (halt-grade; a breach anywhere is HALT):**
- RC-1 replication: eigen-form k(0) − 1 within 10⁻¹²; eigen k(40)
  matches L0-1a's recorded 6.8195192260507686×10⁻⁹ (|rel Δ| < 10⁻⁹);
  the time-domain (β = 0, a = 0.001) leg matches the eigen form on
  the gated grid, sup |r/k − 1| < 10⁻⁶.
- RC-2 integrator self-consistency, **per leg** (all 18): full
  schedule vs halved schedule, sup over the gated grid of
  |rel Δ| < 10⁻⁹ (tolerance set from the review's independent
  two-implementation feasibility measurements at the binding leg,
  with ~30× margin; the audit exists at every leg so §5's Outcome A
  needs no post-result battery addition).
- RC-3 the Lyapunov identity: along every recorded trajectory, V
  non-increasing across consecutive recorded points (all three
  grids), tolerance ΔV ≤ 10⁻¹²·(V_prev + 10⁻³⁰); quadratic V on the
  two linear-continuation runs.
- RC-4 superposition at β = 0: sup over the gated grid of
  |r(τ; a)/r(τ; 0.001) − 1| < 10⁻⁹ for a ∈ {1.0, 3.0}.
- RC-5 the sign identity (§3.2): r > 0 at every recorded point of
  every grid at every leg; any r ≤ 0 anywhere is HALT — never an
  M-line failure, never Outcome A. (M-1's comparator therefore always
  operates on positive data or the run has halted; the guard executes
  before the comparator.)
- RC-6 comparator certification: the textual copy of `fit_residuals`
  + TAUS, applied to the eigen-form anchor kernel, reproduces the
  sealed L0-1a anchor values R_exp = 1.9809889100368165 and
  R_alg = 4.7907669413552245 with |Δ| < 10⁻¹² each, and the grade
  string "EXPONENTIAL-GRADE" exactly.

**X — the deletion is real (conditions every NOT-LOAD-BEARING line):**
- X-1 (gate; certification-grade per §3.5): at both strong legs,
  sup over the gated grid of |r(τ; 3)/r(τ; 0.001) − 1| > 0.1
  (within-member comparison; the a = 0.001 leg is the member's own
  linear regime).
- X-diag (ungated): **D_act**, the linear-continuation activation
  defect at each strong leg — sup over the gated grid of
  |x₁_full(τ)/x₁_lin(τ) − 1| against the §2 linear-continuation run
  (same initial state, same integrator, only the deletion term
  differs; zero iff the deletion is inert in-window) — plus the
  collapse-defect map over all 18 legs and sup |r(τ; 0.001, β)/k − 1|
  per member.

**M — the phenomena under the deletion (Instrument B only; all 18 legs):**
- M-1 (gate) P_memory: the certified comparator classifies r
  EXPONENTIAL-GRADE on the gated window at every leg.
- M-2 (gate) P_positivity, monotone half: steps ≤ +10⁻¹² on the
  gated window at every leg.
- M-3 (gate) P_positivity, Gram half (**the unpreviewed live gate**):
  the 39×39 data Gram G_ij = r(τ_i + τ_j) has minimum eigenvalue
  ≥ −10⁻¹⁰ at every leg (`jacobi_eig` on the data matrix; the
  tolerance clears integration-noise perturbation of the Gram by an
  order of magnitude while leaving genuine violations readable).
- M-diag (ungated): per-leg R_exp/R_alg and grade map; late-slope per
  leg vs the anchor leg's fitted window-tail slope (§3.6.ii); the
  early and early-early transient maps (undershoot status is RC-5's
  domain; shape is mapped here); min Gram eigenvalue per leg.

## 5. Outcome rule (frozen, mechanical; per-property lines, never composed)

**Scope declaration, on the face of every recorded line, under every
outcome including VACUOUS, PARTIAL, and HALT:** *within the declared
background mathematics (real symmetric matrices, exact
eigendecomposition, the frozen RK4 schedule), the convex quartic
on-site class on the C1-a bath (N = 24), the declared amplitudes
a ∈ {0.001, 1.0, 3.0}, window, grids, and comparator.* This sentence
is "the recorded scope" wherever a line names it.

- **LINEARITY: NECESSITY-CERTIFIED for P_exact-reduction** iff RC-4
  and X-1 hold — definitional status on the face (§3.1).
- **LINEARITY: NOT-LOAD-BEARING for P_memory** (at the declared
  amplitudes; the deletion's in-window action recorded at the D_act
  level) iff M-1 holds at every leg AND X-1 holds.
- **LINEARITY: NOT-LOAD-BEARING for P_positivity, as operationalized
  by the declared window-cone battery and the trajectory-Gram PSD
  reading** (at the declared amplitudes; nonnegativity identity-held
  per §3.2, monotone decrease and Gram PSD tested; D_act recorded)
  iff M-2 AND M-3 hold at every leg AND X-1 holds.
- **H3 / Outcome B is certified** iff all three lines land — with the
  §3.4 transient-limited qualifier on the face, citing the scope
  clause above.
- **Outcome A (mechanical):** iff no RC breach anywhere (else HALT),
  X-1 holds, and M-1, M-2, or M-3 fails on the gated window at an
  **adjudicating leg** (a ∈ {1.0, 3.0} of a deleted member).
  Recorded per property and per failing (β, a) set: "linearity is
  load-bearing for P_memory [resp. P_positivity as operationalized]
  at the failing legs, at the recorded scope" — never a composed
  "the phenomena"; the other property's line may still issue. One
  clean gated failure falsifies H3 at the fork's full declared scope;
  the surviving (β, a) set is mapped ungated (M-diag), never issued
  as per-leg certificates. An M-battery failure at a replication or
  control leg is HALT (identity-protected), never Outcome A.
- **L01C-VACUOUS** iff X-1 fails at **both** strong legs (the
  deletion never bit at the tested amplitudes: no NOT-LOAD-BEARING
  line may issue; the honest product is the maps plus a re-charter
  obligation — noting per §3.4 that an in-class re-charter can raise
  the collapse defect but never in-window dominance).
- X-1 failing at one strong leg but not the other →
  **L01C-PARTIAL**, with the collapse map reported, naming which
  strong leg the deletion bit; no NOT-LOAD-BEARING line may issue
  (X-1 is a single conjunction — survival at a leg where the deletion
  never bit certifies nothing), and the re-charter obligation
  attaches at the leg where it failed to bite.
- **L01C-PARTIAL** for any other gate failure; **HALT** on any RC
  breach.
- **Precedence (run-level labels only):** HALT > L01C-VACUOUS >
  Outcome A > L01C-PARTIAL. This orders run-level labels; it neither
  composes nor suppresses the per-property lines. VACUOUS and Outcome
  A are mutually exclusive by construction (X-1 fails-at-both vs
  X-1 holds), so their relative order is inert — recorded to prevent
  a future reader from inferring a live co-fire.

Under every outcome: no v4 channel moves; no red gate is touched;
GR2, L0-1a, L0-1b, and the public paper untouched. **HARD STOP**
after the verdict, pending owner ruling (which decides the
formulability floor — D-ORD / D-HERM / D-DET — and the queued
pin-free locality fork).

## 6. Instrument contract

`calc/l01c_linearity.py`: pure stdlib; imports `build_K` unchanged
(it supplies K_b to both instruments) and `jacobi_eig` unchanged
(Instrument A / RC-1 / RC-6's eigen reference, and M-3's data-Gram
PSD test per §2); carries the certified textual copy of
`fit_residuals` + TAUS (RC-6); RK4 exactly as §2, integer-count
stepping mandated; deterministic, no RNG; single run; the 38
trajectories of §2; writes `L0_1C_RESULT.json` (sha-hashed) with
`defect_history`; runtime minutes. Scope: the §5 scope clause;
nothing else.
